REUTERS/Kham LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Indonesia could phase out coal-fired power plants by 2040 if the country gets sufficient financial help from the international community, its finance minister told Reuters on Tuesday. The Southeast Asian archipelago is the world's fourth most populous country and eighth biggest greenhouse gas emitter with coal accounting for around 65% of its energy mix. It is also the world's biggest coal exporter. Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters during her visit to the Scottish city of Glasgow for the COP26 conference that Indonesia will on Wednesday announce detailed plans to move to cleaner energy, with the phase-out of coal being the key issue. Previously, Indonesia said it planned to phase out coal for electricity by 2056, as part of a plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060 or earlier. ""If we are going to put forward until 2040, then we need to have funding to retire coal earlier and to build the new capacity of renewable energy,"" Sri Mulyani said. ""That is exactly what has now become the core issue and I'm now as the finance minister calculating what does it mean to retire coal earlier. How much does it cost us?,"" she said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week told the UK parliament that President Joko Widodo had said Indonesia is going to bring forward its target to phase out coal to 2040. Indonesia had not previously confirmed such a plan. Sri Mulyani told Reuters that meeting such a target was conditional on getting financial help from multilateral institutions, the private sector and developed countries. ""For Indonesia, retiring coal early will cost us, then it will also cost the people, it will cost the industry,"" she said. ""If this is all supposed to be financed from my taxpayers' money, that won't work. The world is asking us, so now the question is what the world could do to help Indonesia."" She said the plans due to be announced on Wednesday moved Indonesia's climate targets beyond ""rhetoric"" into the technical details and that the Asian Development Bank and other financial institutions were ""very excited"" with their ideas. Indonesia has said it will need to invest $150 billion to $200 billion per year in low carbon programmes over the next nine years to meet its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060 or earlier.

Unemployment in the three months to the end of the September has slumped to 3.4 per cent, Stats NZ has reported. The unemployment rate is down from 4 per cent in the June quarter. Stats NZ work and wellbeing manager Becky Collett said it was the lowest rate of unemployment the country had recorded, matching the rate in the three months to the end of December in 2007, when it was also 3.4 per cent. The number of unemployed fell by 18,000 over the quarter to 98,000, which, combined with 54,000 more people in employment, drove the unemployment rate down, Stats NZ said. READ MORE: * Inflation expectations have gone 'ballistic', ANZ says * New Zealand is staring down the barrel of a recession * Adrian Orr says Reserve Bank only has 'bit role' in unsustainable house prices  “The fall in the unemployment rate is in line with reports of difficulty finding workers and high labour turnover, and continued travel restrictions on international arrivals, which put pressure on domestic labour supply,” Collett said. Westpac acting chief economist Michael Gordon noted Covid restrictions would have nudged the unemployment rate downward a little, as some people were not able to actively look for work. Stats NZ estimated that reduced the headline unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage points, he said. But the “under-utilisation” rate, which measures unemployment along with the proportion of people in work but who would like more hours, and those wanting jobs but who are either unavailable or not actively seeking work – also fell. That rate stood at 9.2 per cent in the September quarter, down sharply from 10.5 per cent in the June quarter. That also matched the record low in that figure in 2007, Stats NZ said. RNZ An economist says a proposed unemployment insurance scheme won't be cheap (video first published in May). The unemployment figure is likely to heap pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates faster, coming after a shock jump in inflation to 4.9 per cent in the September quarter. Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr was preparing to host a media conference on financial stability as the figures came through but declined to comment on the implications for monetary policy. Labour market data, and economic data in general, was “highly volatile at present”, he said. “The underlying trends are very clear,” Orr said. “The Covid economic shock has had a significant impact on the supply side of the economy as well as demand, so we are seeing strong demand for all resources.” Robert Kitchin/Stuff Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr appeared to play down the drop in unemployment, describing economic data as “volatile” at the moment. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the Covid pandemic was likely to see the unemployment rate move around a bit but noted the country’s employment rate – measuring the proportion of people in work – was now the “third highest in the OECD”. “This is a very positive result given the impacts of higher alert level restrictions,” he said. ASB senior economist Jane Turner described the labour market as “scorching hot”. Most analysts and the Reserve Bank had been expecting the rate to come in at 3.9 per cent, she said. Stats NZ said average ordinary-time hourly earnings, as measured by its Quarterly Employment Survey, increased 3.5 per cent over the year to reach $35.25 an hour. But Turner said “wage inflation” was slightly more modest than the bank and the market had expected, with pay rising 0.7 per cent over the previous quarter, versus forecasts of 0.8 per cent. Annual wage inflation among full-time workers in the private sector rose to 2.5 per cent, from 2.2 per cent, Turner said. “Given the extremely tight labour market and rising cost of living, we expect wage inflation will continue to rise to an annual rate of 3 per cent over the coming year,” she said. ANZ said the unemployment data reinforced the fact the jobs market had been “incredibly resilient” to Covid restrictions. “Today’s data showed no signs of weakness, despite the economy spending half the quarter in lockdown,” the bank said in a research note. The main impact of the lockdown would probably not show through until the December quarter figures were released early next year, it said. “But so far, the labour market shows no signs of slowing down.”"

Madagascar on the verge of climate change-induced famine: How to help","2021-11-02 21:28:54-05","AMBOVOMBE, MADAGASCAR -- ""Kere"" is a word that echoes around southern Madagascar. It means hunger, and the people here know it all too well. For the past four years, the lack of food has become a constant in their lives. But unlike other countries, where extreme hunger and near-famine conditions are caused by war, conflict, or isolated weather events, in this part of Madagascar, the cause is so far unique: southern Madagascar is on the verge of becoming the world's first climate-change induced near-famine in modern history. Arduino Mangoni, the deputy country director of the World Food Programme in Madagascar, told ABC News he had ""never seen people, especially children, in this situation that we’re seeing here."" ""I have seen people eating cactus leaves, insects, and surviving upon nothing, and the lack of water is probably the most striking element,"" he said. ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir and his team traveled to Madagascar to report on the worsening situation, as aid organizations and the Malagasy government rush to fill in the gaps of food and water in this region. Southern Madagascar is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, making the land here too arid to farm and leading to crop failure. For the past four years, the severe lack of rain has led to depleted food sources and dried-up rivers. Climate change has also led to sandstorms affecting these lands, covering formerly arable land and rendering it infertile. ""As they cannot plant, it’s affecting their food security,"" Patrick Vercammen, the World Food Programme's emergency coordinator here, told Muir during a visit to Akanka Fokotany, an affected village. ""Having sandstorms in this kind of landscape is not something usual and having the effects of sandstorms shows that nature is changing, the environment is changing, and the climate change is affecting this area more than the rest of Madagascar."" The situation has led to widespread malnutrition affecting more than 1 million people, and pockets of what the United Nations classifies ""catastrophic"" food insecurity signaling deepening hunger. Madagascar has produced 0.01 percent of the world’s annual carbon emissions in the last eight decades, but it is suffering some of the worst effects. ""It is not fair...these people have not contributed to climate change because they do not have electricity, they do not have cars etc., and they’re paying probably the highest price in terms of the consequences of climate change,"" Mangoni said. The children are the most affected, with at least half a million kids under the age of five expected to be acutely malnourished, according to the World Food Programme and UNICEF. In fact, the agencies say about 110,000 children are already in severe condition, suffering irreversible damage to their growth. As the country enters the lean season - that dangerous time during which people wait for the next successful harvest -- the need to provide food to those at risk of starvation has become more urgent. Aid workers warning that, without action, they could run out of food resources by the end of the year. The World Food Programme is working together with the Malagasy government to alleviate some of the most acute needs in this region; prevent and treat children experiencing malnutrition; and build infrastructure and knowledge to make the population of southern Madagascar more resilient in the face of drought. They're supporting more than 700,000 people in dire need, and the need is expected to grow. Click here for more information about the U.N. World Food Programme’s lifesaving support in Madagascar.

According to The Guardian, Queensland Police seized the banner from a UniLodge complex, which provides student housing, on Saturday after it was seen by worshipers at the synagogue, but only charged its owner with creating a public nuisance. “That flag and that symbol, the Nazi swastika symbol, represents one of the most evil moments in human history. For that to appear in 2021 in Brisbane over a synagogue is just atrocious,” Jason Steinberg, the vice president of the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies, told the paper, calling on the legislature to tighten up hate laws. The incident came only weeks after Australia announced that it was adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism, joining a growing list of nations across Europe and the Americas to agree on a common description of anti-Jewish bias. “Antisemitism has no place in Australia,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced earlier this month, The Guardian reported. “It has no place anywhere in the world. And we must work together, resolutely and as a global community to reject any word or any act that supports antisemitism towards individuals, towards communities or religious facilities.” A global survey undertaken by the Anti-Defamation League in 2014 found that Australia distinguished itself as one the least antisemitic countries in the world. That seems to be borne out by the findings in a survey conducted earlier this year by Australia’s Social Research Center on behalf of Plus61J – an online news publication focusing on Israel, Australia and the Jewish world. To gauge levels of antisemitism in the country, respondents were asked how open they were to befriending Jews and to what degree they accepted certain negative stereotypes about Jews. A total of 92 percent said they were as comfortable having Jewish friends as having friends from other groups in society. About 116,000 Jews live in Australia, where they account for a tiny fraction of the population – 0.4 percent. More than four out of five respondents, however, overestimated their share, with 40 percent saying it was more than 5 percent. More than 80 percent of respondents disagreed with the notions that Jewish people talk about the Holocaust to further their agenda and that they can’t be trusted in business. Well over 70 percent rejected claims that Jews consider themselves better than other Australians, that they have too much power in the media and that they are more obsessed with money than other Australians. It is a sign of how aligned most Australians feel with the local Jewish population that nearly two out of every three respondents (62 percent) said they supported banning the swastika in their country in order to protect Jewish people from antisemitism – just 12 percent disagreed. But despite their overwhelming revulsion from the Nazi symbol, 30 percent of the respondents said they knew “little” or “virtually nothing” about the Holocaust. But while Australians hold a very favorable view of the local Jewish community, the study also found that nearly one in five believe that their connection to Israel compromises their loyalty to Australia."

Bourassa, a U of S professor and the scientific director of the Indigenous health arm of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), has been put on leave from both institutions after CBC's investigation into her claims to Indigeneity sparked online outrage. The U of S also announced Monday that it had launched an investigation into Bourassa's claims. Bourassa, who headed up an Indigenous research lab at the U of S and the CIHR's Institute of Indigenous Peoples' Health, had publicly claimed to be Métis, Anishinaabe and Tlingit. CBC found there was no evidence she was Indigenous, despite her claims that she was many times over the past 20 years. When asked, Bourassa hasn't offered any genealogical evidence to back up her claims, but in a statement she said that two years ago she hired a genealogist to help her investigate her ancestry and that work continues. Caroline Tait, a professor in the department of psychiatry at U of S, had been looking into Bourassa's ancestry claims for quite a while along with some colleagues. She filed a complaint to the university about the issue. ""One of the most difficult challenges for all of us was that Carrie Bourassa was supervising students and giving lectures, going to conferences, and interacting with our elders,"" said Tait, who is Métis. ""When the news came out, [we knew] that there would be people that were very hurt and particularly the students. The most difficult piece of this is the people who looked up to her."" Tait said she is pleased that the university is pursuing an investigation as it is an appropriate opportunity for Bourassa to defend her position. From left, U of S professor Caroline Tait, Bourassa and Marg Friesen, minister of health for the Métis Nation Saskatchewan. Tait, who is Métis, raised concerns about Bourassa's claims to Indigenous ancestry with the university. (goaliegirlmom31/Twitter) Academic integrity played part in complaint Tait said Bourassa being put on leave is ""bittersweet,"" because she and her colleagues had not ""set out to confirm that Carrie Bourassa wasn't Indigenous."" She said they wanted to know if she was being dishonest and that they set out as researchers ""to find the truth."" Tait said their intent was never to publicly shame Bourassa but instead to combat the prevalent identity fraud among Indigenous scholars. ""If the identity fraud is an epidemic across the country, then this example that we have before us is a catalyst to start a national conversation. We need a national committee made up of Indigenous lawyers, cultural people, our elders and knowledge keepers from the different places and cultural vantage points to push that conversation,"" she said. Tait said that in 2018, Bourassa was staying at her house. She said it was then that she suggested to Bourassa that she should show everyone her genealogy to put all the rumours to rest. ""We were bringing this forward not only because of Indigenous people bringing forward that someone claiming to be Indigenous is not, but also because of academic integrity."" Tait said tenured professors have the responsibility to tell the truth and are held to the highest standards. She said it was heartening to see that although they were upset, ""the Métis women were mobilizing … locally here in Saskatoon."" Tait said she was initially surprised by the university and CIHR's support for Bourassa, but that their decisions to put her on leave were progress in the right direction. ""I think the university may have taken a slight misstep. I think they have corrected the misstep."" She said she hopes the investigation committee will be composed of all Indigenous people, including Indigenous lawyers and elders. Going forward, Tait said she wants to see a process of trust building among students, faculty and staff at the university. She said what is happening with Bourassa might worsen the withering trust Indigenous people held generally in university research. Tait is also worried it would mean more scrutiny for Indigenous people. ""There's going to be increased scrutiny over every Indigenous person, whether it's a student or a staff member, and so now, it will land on our shoulders to prove who we are. So every meeting I go into now, without people asking, I pull out my Métis citizenship card,"" she said. Bourassa usurped resources, professor says Raven Sinclair, a professor of social work at University of Regina, told CBC's The Current that when the investigative report came out, ""it was really quite shocking"" to see the suspicions were ""in fact reality."" ""It has to do with material gain and advantage of position, power, authority and role,"" she said. ""A lot of things come down to money. There must be rewards that start to accrue and those become incentive in themselves to continue with this charade."" University of Regina professor Raven Sinclair said Bourassa's claims have affected Indigenous participation in the economy and that she usurped culture and resources from individuals who were on a similar career trajectory. (University of Regina) Sinclair said Bourassa usurped culture and resources from individuals who were on a similar career trajectory, and that such events affect Indigenous participation in the economy. ""We take those community relations at face value, so when these suspicions come up, it is somewhat contrary to our values of relationality to challenge people. We don't assume somebody's history or stories they share about their experiences are fabrications."" Sinclair said she can track her genealogy back to 10 generations on her mother's side and five on her father's. ""Just saying you are Indigenous isn't acceptable,"" she said."

Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, describes itself as ""an interactive livestreaming service for content spanning gaming, entertainment, sports and music"". The scandal surfaced after an anonymous hacker leaked Twitch’s source code and user payout information online last month. Why Turkey's plan for a cyber homeland is doomed to fail Read More » Having examined the leak, users in Turkey quickly realised something was odd - streamers with little to almost no following were earning thousands of dollars through a platform called Bit, which allows viewers to express their appreciation to the hosts with special paid emojis. Twitch transfers one percent of income obtained through Bit to the individual streamers. Some were found to be earning up to $1,800 a day, despite have just 40 to 50 viewers. Under the scam, hackers firstly allegedly stole or obtained the credit card information of random individuals. They then negotiated deals with Twitch streamers to send them large payments of money through Bit. The streamers would then refund 80 percent of the money they received to different bank accounts belonging to the hackers, effectively laundering the money. 'Clean Twitch' Global Twitch streamers, who became aware of the money laundering scam following the leak, last month began a social media campaign on Twitter via a hashtag called #dobettertwitch. Turkish Twitch users then started their own campaign with a hashtag calling for a “clean Twitch” (#temizTwitch). According to the calculations by the Turkish news website Haberler.com, a total of $9.8m was laundered through 2,400 Turkish streamers over the past two years. 111-Mitraleius 0 $ 0 $ 1000 $ 1000 $ 0 $ 0 $ pic.twitter.com/Iih5WFP3pr — #TemizTwitch (@TemizBirTwitch) October 31, 2021 A Twitter account named TemizBirTwitch (a clean Twitch) periodically shares the broadcasters who allegedly received irregular Bit payments Turkish Twitch streamer Grimnax, who is one of the campaigners, earlier this week revealed a conversation he had with one of the scammers, posting the screenshots on Twitter. The screenshots suggest a person named Sinan had offered him a 20 percent cut of the Bit income per broadcast if he agreed to refund the remaining amount of money. “This is something that many of us have been aware of for a long time, but we couldn’t confirm Twitch and the owner Amazon nor the audience for years,” Grinmax told Middle East Eye. “We waited for the prominent names on the platform to talk about this issue, as I and mid-level influencers like me weren't loud enough.” Hala devam ediyor teklifler gelmeye.

I'm not a good enough publisher I guess they only leave me 20 percent"" Grinmax said following the expose of the scandal by prominent Twitch streamers, now even lawmakers have become interested in the issue. “I want people to realise how big this fraud is, not only in Turkey but also globally,” he added. Jahrein, one of the most well known influencers, who has 1.7 million followers on Twitch, has become the flag bearer of the issue and publicly called on Twitch to act. With Jahrein, whose real name is Ahmet Sonuc, and other influencers’ efforts, authorities have now started investigating the issue. “I have testified and shared data I have with the police cybercrime office about fraud,” Jahrein said in a broadcast this week. After meeting with Jahrein, Gursel Tekin, an Istanbul deputy from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), presented a motion to parliament calling for the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (Masak) and other relevant Turkish state institutions to scrutinise the scandal. “After our motion became public, a lot of people reached us,"" Tekin told MEE. ""They were all victims. We've heard very interesting stories, we don't know how many of them are true or false. Our duty is to bring the allegations about this fraud to the public arena.” Other streamers like Iro Sako also said that without the public leak, which contained 125 gigabytes of information, no one would have been able to pick up on the irregularities on the platform. “Even though I am a mid-band streamer, I decided to take the initiative and start an awareness movement called a clean twitch, trusting my audience and teammates,'' Sako told MEE. 'Decisive action' A Twitch spokesperson told MEE the company had taken action against 150 streamers in Turkey for abuse of its monetisation tools. ""We want to assure our community that we will not hesitate to take decisive action against accounts engaged in prohibited conduct,” the spokersperon said. “We take efforts to combat and prevent financial fraud on Twitch on a regular basis, and, in September alone, we took action against more than 150 partners in Turkey for abuse of our monetisation tools. ""We have also worked with those affected who have reached out to us.” Twitch underlined that the company would continue to identify and remove any streamers found to have engaged in financial practices that were in violation of local laws or Twitch policies. Some of the people whose credit card information was stolen under the scam have highlighted their plight on Twitter and Turkish sites like Sikayet Var, where consumers share their complaints and problems about products and services to find solutions.

Now a new supply crisis has emerged to further jolt the industry. Magnesium is a key raw material used in the making of aluminum alloys, which are used extensively in car production. Magnesium strengthens aluminum even though it is a much lighter material. China dominates the global magnesium sector but production stalled in September and October due to the ongoing energy crisis in the country. This year has seen prolonged electricity and power blackouts in China as Beijing struggles to keep up with soaring global demand for its exports while also cutting back on its use of coal. With China producing around 90% of the world's magnesium, curbs on production have a swift knock-on effect down the supply chain. The EU is particularly dependent, with around 95% of its supply coming from China. In late October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), along with 11 other industrial trade associations, issued a stark warning about the impending magnesium shortage. ""Europe is expected to run out of magnesium stocks by the end of November, with production shortages, business closures and associated job losses to follow,"" it warned. China dominates the global magnesium sector Ar-Mg-eddon? Like many other firms, Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminum producer, relies heavily on Chinese magnesium. ""We are concerned about the availability of magnesium, but between a combination of the stocks we already have and the shipments that have already been sent, we are well covered throughout this year,"" Halvor Molland, a senior vice president at the company, told DW. He says the company's production of aluminum for auto industry parts makers (OEMs) has not yet been disrupted. However, he shares concerns that if power cuts and production curbs drag on into 2022, aluminum production could be affected. At the recent European Council summit in Brussels, the issue of a major magnesium shortage was reportedly raised by outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, both leaders of big car-producing nations. With existing stocks in Europe dwindling, metals industry analysts have pointed to the lack of an alternative to magnesium in aluminum billet production as a major risk. Moreover, China's domination of the market means alternative sources of magnesium on the scale required should the Chinese shutdown persist simply do not exist. Carmakers around the world have already been forced to postpone the production of millions of new vehicles in 2021 due to the semiconductor shortage. An aluminum crisis could severely compound that problem. China accounts for more than 85% of global magnesium production While carmakers would bear the brunt, plenty of other magnesium-reliant sectors would also be hit, such as packaging, consumer electronics and household appliances. WV Metalle, a German metals trade association, warned last month that if Europe's magnesium stocks were to collapse by the end of November, there would be a risk of ""massive production losses."" The situation in China Blackouts and electricity rationing in China have forced a majority of magnesium producers offline in recent months, dramatically lowering output and driving the market price of magnesium to record highs. ""Today's remaining magnesium imports are trading at 'extortionate prices' of about $10,000 to $14,000 per ton, up from approximately $2,000 per ton earlier this year, making it almost impossible for European companies to produce or source magnesium-containing materials at a viable level,"" the European industry associations warned last month. However, there are some signs that the problems may be easing. Shanghai Metals Market, a consultancy, said last week that magnesium producers in China's Shaanxi province — the epicenter of the country's magnesium industry — were now back to between 70% and 80% of their capacity. Prices have begun to fall in recent days as a result. Norsk Hydro says it is ""too early"" to expect a turnaround. The chip shortage has already caused major problems for carmakers Even if Chinese production does continue to ramp up, European Aluminium, one of whose members is Norsk Hydro, is concerned that China will prioritize its own producers' huge demand for magnesium. It says the EU needs to develop a stronger and more coherent metals strategy to stave off such crises in the future. That will be easier said than done. While magnesium is already listed as a critical raw material by the EU, European production is unlikely to take off anytime soon. China's dominance of the market is largely based on the fact that its firms can operate far more cheaply than international rivals. The European Commission says it has opened talks with the Chinese ""in order to address immediate shortages"" and that it is ""assessing long-term solutions to tackle this strategic dependency."""

If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it. —@elonmusk In the interview, Beasley said billionaires could give ""$6 billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don't reach them."" ""It's not complicated,"" he said. That money would be approximately two per cent of Musk's fortune, nearly $300 billion US, according to Forbes.

Photos: Supplied Officials from the UK’s Government Equalities Office organised a private meeting with “ex-gay” leaders of a group that delivers a form of so-called conversion therapy, VICE World News has learned. A representative from Core Issues Trust told VICE World News that the group’s leaders have “spent years” trying to speak to the UK government about how they “help people who want to move away from unwanted homosexual feelings”, but they’ve always been ignored – until this year. Advertisement Following communications with equalities minister Kemi Badenoch in June this year – LGBTQ Pride Month – the group was then invited to what it called a “productive” meeting. The group also told VICE World News that it had recently posted every single UK MP a new book called X-Out-Loud: Emerging Ex-LGBT Voices. It features 44 stories from people who claim they are “former homosexuals” or that they turned away from “LGBT lifestyles”. “In the midst of a sexual affair with another woman, I tearfully asked for a Bible,” one person writes in the book. “Later on, I received specific prayer which freed me from demonic spirits. I vomited blood and screamed like a maniac.” Last month, Carrie Johnson, an environmental campaigner and the UK prime minister's wife, made headlines when she praised her husband's plans to ban conversion therapy. She said he is ""completely committed"" to protecting LGBTQ rights. Speaking at an LGBTQ reception at the Conservative Party conference, she added: ""Whether you are LGBT+ or an ally like me, we are all committed to equality and acceptance for everyone, whoever you are and whoever you love."" A spokesperson for the government’s Equality Hub, which works with several departments including the Equalities Office, said: ""The Government's values do not align with those of the Core Issues Trust. We believe that conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice and will shortly publish our plans to ban it in this country."" Carrie Johnson speaks at an LGBTQ Pride event at the Conservative Party's annual conference in October. Photo: Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire/Bloomberg via Getty Images However, emails forwarded to VICE World News from July 2021 imply that government officials were eager to speak to the group, following communications with Badenoch. The government actually ended up meeting with what Core Issues Trust described as ten “former LGBT people”. Core Issues Trust is a charity based in Northern Ireland, where it actively promotes “talking therapy” for people who want to “explore moving away from unwanted same-sex attraction and gender confusion”. It is one of the most vocal lobbying groups for conversion therapy in the UK. Advertisement The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or therapy that aims to change a person's sexual orientation or suppress a person's gender identity. Some violent practices that may be classed as conversion therapy – such as ""corrective rape"" – are already illegal in the UK, but many religious practices are not, including those carried out by Core Issues Trust. Former UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s government promised to ban conversion therapy in 2018. Boris Johnson’s government is currently running a six-week consultation about how to “end” conversion therapy, but campaigners have said that current plans do not go far enough. Currently, “therapies” would only be banned for people under 18 and for those who do not actively seek it, so Core Issues Trust expects to be able to continue operating. After some viral social media posts last year, some of the Core Issue Trust’s content and services promoting conversion therapies were banned from Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms. Advertisement Exactly one year later, officials from the Government Equalities Office met with the group. A representative from Core Issues Trust told VICE World News that it was the first time any government has “taken the time to speak to former-LGBT people.” An email sent from the Equalities Office to the group, seen by VICE World News, suggests eagerness from the office to set up a meeting. The invitation says: “I am part of the conversion therapy team in GEO, and am reaching out to arrange a meeting with yourself ahead of the launch of the conversion therapy consultation, following on from a letter from the Minister for Equalities last month. “Unsure of your availability within the next week or so, but we're happy to work around your schedule as much as possible. Please see below for some suggested times next week.” The charity’s representative said the “productive” meeting went ahead in July. The government advisers “listened respectfully” and “encouraged” the large group of “ex-LGBT people” to participate in the upcoming public consultation on conversion therapy. They continued: “We've asked for meetings before and never been given anything. So, you know, this was a step in the right direction.” “It was just officials from the equalities office. It was a brief meeting. I think it was just over half an hour, maybe 40 minutes in total. “We tried to speak to Theresa May’s government, and on two occasions had tried to contact them. We have no record of the government, or of any government, ever taking time to speak to former LGBT persons until now.” Advertisement MPs from across the UK – who began receiving books from Core Issues Trust last week – have called the content “horrific”. “After continuing to pray, to live with God, and to say no to temptation, I saw how my same-sex attraction diminished, as did my desire for same-sex relationships,” one woman writes. An intro in the book says, “X-Out-Loud (a Core Issues Trust project) is an international community based in Europe, and like several other groups is contributing to the growth of the emerging former LGBT community.” It continues: “We ask the government ministers and peers in Westminster as well as politicians in the devolved governments across the UK consider carefully the damage that will be caused by banning the right and freedom to leave unwanted sexual practices.” VICE World News was contacted by “worried” staff working within parliament who received the book. ""The book came with our post on Friday, which I sort through every day. Some of the testimonials are shocking,” one parliamentary staffer said. “I'm really worried about how organisations opposing the ban on conversion therapy are reaching out to MPs like this.” All the “testimonials” are from people who claim they “overcame” same-sex attraction with the help of Christianity. “I am 22 years old and I no longer identify as gay,” says one man. “I also made the decision to stop pursuing a gay lifestyle because my soul did not like what I was doing.” Advertisement Asked if any MPs have responded to their book donation yet, the Core Issues Trust representative replied: “We’ve had a couple of letters thanking us, that kind of thing. But it’s very early days because it only just arrived.” They were not willing to share specific communications. John Nicolson, the Scottish National Party’s shadow culture secretary and deputy chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global LGBT+ Rights, said “my copy of the X-Out-Loud booklet has gone straight into the recycling bin.” He continued: “Conversion therapy is a horrific practice. It’s cruel. It doesn’t work. And it gives false hope to the most vulnerable in society. Its practitioners are malevolent. I support the banning of so-called ‘conversion therapy’ under all circumstances.” Anneliese Dodds, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said: “Over three years since the Conservatives promised a ban on conversion therapy, LGBT+ people will be appalled to learn that the Government body responsible for protecting their rights is now holding private meetings with a group that promotes this insidious practice.”"

(Steve Reigate /Pool Photo via AP) More than 120 world leaders were heading home after two days in which they received stark warnings about the state of the Earth from Johnson, naturalist David Attenborough, Queen Elizabeth II and — most powerfully — the people of countries and regions already facing climate upheaval. Johnson said at a news conference that it was important to “guard against false hope,” but added that he was “cautiously optimistic” about the outcome of the talks. The conference aims to keep the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels — the goal set at the Paris climate conference six years ago. © Provided by Associated Press President Joe Biden listens to a question during a news conference at the COP26 U.N. Climate Summit, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021, in Glasgow, Scotland. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Johnson had a message for negotiators from around the globe who will strain over the next 10 days to turn politicians' climate promises into reality: “The eyes of the populations of the world are on you.” The U.K. said it has received pledges from leaders representing more than 85% of the world’s forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with massive forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged toward the plan. Experts and observers said fulfilling the pledge will be critical to limiting climate change, but many noted that such grand promises have been made before — to little effect. “Signing the declaration is the easy part,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Twitter. “It is essential that it is implemented now for people and planet.” Alison Hoare, a senior research fellow at political think tank Chatham House, said world leaders promised in 2014 to end deforestation by 2030, “but since then deforestation has accelerated across many countries.” © Provided by Associated Press Britain's Prince Charles, center, arrives with worldwide indigenous leaders ahead of a session on Action on Forests and Land Use, during the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021. (Chris Jackson/Pool Photo via AP) Forests are important ecosystems and provide a critical way of absorbing carbon dioxide — the main greenhouse gas — from the atmosphere. But the value of wood as a commodity and the growing demand for agricultural and pastoral land are leading to widespread and often illegal felling of forests, particularly in developing countries. Indigenous peoples are often among the hardest hit. © Provided by Associated Press Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, right, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend the World Leaders' Summit ""Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment"", at the COP26 Summit, in Glasgow, Scotland, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

Some campaigners said the forests pledge was a step forward. Luciana Tellez Chavez, an environmental researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there were “quite a lot of really positive elements.” She said it was positive to see China and Brazil pledging to protect forests, but noted that Brazil's public statements don't yet line up with its domestic policies and warned that the deal could be used by some countries to “greenwash” their image. © Provided by Associated Press President of the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad (AFPAT), Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim speaks during a session on Action on Forests and Land Use, during the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

(Paul Ellis/Pool Photo via AP) On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden launched a plan to reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. The announcement was part of a broader effort with the European Union and other nations to reduce overall methane emissions worldwide by 30% by 2030. Clamping down on methane flaring and leaks from oil wells and gas pipelines — the focus of the Biden plan — is considered one of the easiest ways to cut emissions. Reducing methane from agriculture, in particular by belching cows, is a trickier matter. Helen Mountford, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute, said the agreement “sets a strong floor in terms of the ambition we need globally.” Separately, the U.S., Britain, France and Germany announced a plan to provide $8.5 billion in loans and grants over five years to help South Africa phase out coal. South Africa gets about 90% of its electricity from coal-fired plants, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. But campaigners say the world’s biggest carbon emitters need to do much more. Earth has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2F). Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C (4.9F) by the year 2100. Increased warming over coming decades would melt much of the planet’s ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, scientists say. “I don’t think that activists are being heard here,"" said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist from the Philippines. “We have to make sure that we really rally together and make sure that we’re so loud that the world leaders can’t keep ignoring us,” she said. ""Because every fraction of a degree, every step towards the right direction is what matters here.” At his end-of-summit news conference. Biden acknowledged the fierce skepticism from climate activists who say world leaders are not moving with enough haste. He insisted that climate activists have been a “vital voice,” and expressed optimism that the world is waking up to understanding that the issue is not just a “moral imperative” but also an “enormous opportunity” to spur economies. “Even if the funding didn’t come from some of the governments, you have the private sector now engaged where they’re talking about investing —literally the need to invest over trillions of dollars off the sidelines,” Biden said. “So things are changing.,” he added. “We just have to have the right stewardship and enough sense as world leaders to get it right.” Some 25,000 people are expected to attend the vast COP26 gathering, from heads of state to activists and charity workers. Attendees on Tuesday included Leonardo DiCaprio, who drew a crowd of journalists and fans.

Biden said the leader of the world’s biggest greenhouse-gas-emitting country made a “big mistake” with his absence. “They’ve lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP,” Biden said As countries announced major initiatives, those attendees appeared ready to do their small part: For a few minutes Tuesday, the vegetarian version of haggis — a Scottish delicacy typically made with sheep's lungs — was sold out. It was outselling the traditional version, servers said — perhaps unsurprising in a crowd well aware of the impact of meat-eating on the climate. © Provided by Associated Press Leonardo DiCaprio, center, visits the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

""It's like rubbing salt in the wound,"" she said. On October 20, Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban's interim interior minister, lauded the ""sacrifices"" of the suicide bombers, who perpetrated countless violent attacks across Afghanistan during the 20-year US occupation of the country. At a ceremony in a hotel in Kabul, the minister rewarded the relatives of suicide bombers by offering them cash and land. Qari Saeed Khosty, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said in a tweet that the Taliban could not have returned to power without the help from the suicide bombers. The Taliban's glorification of suicide bombers angered many Afghans, especially those who have lost their loved ones in suicide attacks. ""When I heard that instead of helping us, they [the Taliban] are praising those who intentionally killed themselves and others, I was heartbroken,"" Sharifa told DW over the phone. In 2018, a Taliban suicide bomber targeted the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing 95 people and wounding at least 185. Sharifa's father was one among the dead. ""Our lives were ruined after the death of our father. My mother and brother became mentally unstable,"" she said. Watch video 01:32 Dozens killed in Afghanistan mosque blast How suicide bombings devastated families Aziz, 56, lost his two sons in a suicide attack near Kabul. In March 2018, an ""Islamic State"" Khorasan (IS-K) suicide bomber targeted people celebrating ""Nawroz,"" the Afghan New Year, outside Kabul. Among the 26 dead were 24-year-old Mehdi and nine-year-old Rohullah. ""We were planning Mehdi's wedding and graduation ceremonies prior to the bombing,"" Aziz told DW. Aziz said his life completely changed after he lost his sons, and that he and his wife are unable to lead a normal life. ""We couldn't eat well. We also plunged into more poverty as we lost the son who had a steady income,"" he added. Aziz also learned about the Taliban's ceremony for the families of suicide bombers. ""I have nothing to say about it. They took away our sons without a reason. Life has become meaningless to me. They should kill me too,"" he said. The Kabul ceremony to honor suicide bombers not only offended the victims' families, it also drew wide-ranging criticism on Afghanistan's social media. ""In the near future, visit a new residential town for suicide bombers in Kabul,"" Sayed Tariq Majidi, a former investigative journalist, posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. Thousands of Afghans have become handicapped due to suicide bombings and have lost their jobs The dilemma While the Taliban are praising their own suicide bombers, the IS-K suicide attacks pose a major threat to their rule. The terror group claimed responsibility for the October 15 suicide attack on the Shiite Fatima Mosque in Kandahar, which killed at least 100 people. The attack came a week after a similar assault on a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz that killed around 80 people and wounded dozens. Mohammad Dawood, who lost many relatives in the Kunduz mosque attack, fears a rise in violence in Afghanistan. ""It is only the beginning. God knows what the future holds!"" Analysts point to a rift within the Taliban leadership over how to run the country. While the hardline factions, including the Haqqani Network, want to take stricter measures, some commanders prefer a ""moderate"" approach to allay the West's concerns about human rights and free speech. The Taliban government desperately needs foreign aid amid a worsening economic crisis in the country. At the same time, the Islamic fundamentalist group cannot afford to lose their hardline cadre and fighters, who could change allegiance and join the IS-K ranks. Experts say the celebration of suicide bombers should be viewed in this regard."

It added that Yahoo “remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet.” The company’s withdrawal will coincide with China’s Personal Information Protection Law coming into effect on Nov. 1, which curbs what information companies can gather and sets standards for how it must be stored. Yahoo had previously downsized operations in China, and in 2015 shuttered its Beijing office. Its withdrawal from the country is largely symbolic as at least some of Yahoo’s services, including its web portal, have already been blocked. Chinese authorities maintain a firm grip on Internet censorship in the country, and require companies operating in China to censor content and keywords deemed politically sensitive or inappropriate. China has also blocked most international social media sites and search engines, such as Facebook and Google. Users in China who wish to access these services circumvent the block by using a virtual private network (VPN). Yahoo also previously operated a music and email service in China, but both services were also stopped in the early 2010s. Yahoo is the second large U.S. technology firm in recent weeks to reduce its operations in China. Last month, Microsoft’s professional networking platform LinkedIn said it would shutter its Chinese site, replacing it with a jobs board instead."

Among those killed were three women, a child, and three Taliban guards, said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Five attackers were also killed, he said, adding that Taliban guards prevented them from getting into the hospital. He said the attack was over within 15 minutes. ""No one was killed inside the hospital,"" the spokesman said. He said Taliban guards thwarted IS plans to target medical staff and patients in the 400-bed facility. He said Taliban special forces were subsequently deployed and searched the hospital and that a helicopter was used in the operation. Health officials said 16 people were wounded in the attack on the Sardar Mohammad Dawood Khan hospital in Kabul's 10th district. Mujahid said five Taliban fighters were among the wounded. Earlier, another Taliban official had said the attack was carried out by six men, and that two of them were captured. During the attack, city residents had reported two explosions in the area, along with the sound of gunfire. In recent weeks, IS militants carried out a series of bombing and shooting attacks.

Around 400 private jets carrying heads of state, billionaires, business leaders and celebrities have converged on Glasgow for a global warming summit.

Jeff Bezos was one of the 400 VIPs flying into the COP26 climate summit by private jet. Picture: Brendan Smialowski/AFP “It can’t be stressed enough how bad private jets are for the environment, it is the worst way to travel by miles,” Matt Finch from the UK’s Transport and Environment campaign group told Scotland’s Sunday Mail. “The average private jet, and we are not talking Air Force One, emits two tonnes of CO2 for every hour in flight. Private jets are very prestigious but it is difficult to avoid the hypocrisy of using one while claiming to be fighting climate change.” He said for context, the “total carbon footprint of an ordinary citizen – including everywhere they travel and everything they consume – is around eight tonnes a year”. Jeff Bezos looks at the COP26 climate summit. Picture: ALAIN JOCARD/AFP In total, the 400 private aircraft are expected to emit some 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. But UK Secretary of State Liz Truss defended the large number of planes flying into Glasgow, saying “it’s really important that we do have people face to face”. “I think everybody who’s ever done a Zoom call knows that they’re quite useful for some things,” Ms Truss told BBC Breakfast. “But when you really get into crunch negotiations. When you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face to face, you do need to meet in person. And this is really critical.” She added, “World leaders are going to have to make some tough decisions about what’s going on in their own countries. They’re going to have to commit to things they didn’t necessarily want to when they arrived at the conference. “And that’s why it’s really important that we do have people face to face and these negotiations can take place. We can make a real difference.” Climate campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio took to Twitter on Monday, writing, “The climate crisis is here. #COP26 must be a turning point to protect people and the planet. “Leaders, the world is watching and urging you to rise to this moment. There’s no time to lose.” Page Six reported that representatives for DiCaprio didn’t comment, neither did reps for Bezos — who also just caused controversy by partying with Bill Gates on a mega-yacht off the coast of Turkey. But sources said DiCaprio was one VIP attendee who flew commercial to the conference. He was spotted at Heathrow airport in London connecting flights, a source exclusively told Page Six. In July 2019 there was a similar outcry when A-listers arrived to the Google summit in Sicily — to discuss climate change — in a convoy of private jets and mega-yachts. Guests including former President Barack Obama, Prince Harry, DiCaprio and Katy Perry converged to the Sicilian seaside for the mega-party dubbed Google Camp, while local media reported 114 private jets were scheduled to arrive."

At a Cop26 event alongside the Prince of Wales and French president Emmanuel Macron, the Amazon founder said he would match a previous contribution made through his Bezos Earth Fund. The event highlighted the Great Green Wall initiative, which will plant 20million trees across the width of Africa to counter desertification on the continent. Prince Charles played a key role in getting Jeff Bezos (both pictured having tea together in Rome on Sunday) to pledge £732million for land restoration in Africa, it has emerged Mr Bezos said: 'We all know that this is the decisive decade, but without action, it will become the indecisive decade. 'We can't let that happen. Please consider us an ally for this important cause.' It came after Prince Charles hosted the businessman and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, for tea and an informal chat after the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday.

He also drew criticism from climate activists earlier this year - and tacit disapproval from Prince William - after using a project he funded to go to space. Yesterday, Ms Sanchez posted several pictures of the 'private' meeting on her Instagram account. The meeting was apparently to discuss Bezos' commitment ahead of the meeting. Bezos later tweeted: 'The Prince of Wales has been involved in fighting climate change and protecting our beautiful world far longer than most.

But after 109 years, modern pentathlon’s governing body has voted secretly to remove horse riding and replace it with cycling, the Guardian can reveal. Multiple sources have said the decision was taken by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne’s executive board in recent days, and was hastened by the distressing scenes at the Tokyo Olympics when a horse was punched by a German coach after it refused to jump a fence. Those pictures made global headlines and the UIPM is understood to have acted in order to preserve its status in the Olympics in the lead-up to the Paris 2024 Games. While the decision has not yet been announced officially, it is already facing a backlash from some countries who believe that losing the horse-riding element fundamentally changes the sport. Modern pentathlon has been a core Olympic event since 1912 when it was invented by Pierre de Coubertin – and while it has since moved from a five-day event to a solitary day it has always tested athletes in fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting, and cross-country running. The UIPM refused to deny the story when confronted by the Guardian, with a spokesperson saying: “I am not able to give you any information right now.” However, the organisation later released a statement: “As part of UIPM’s commitment to maintaining a strong, dynamic profile for modern pentathlon, a series of strategic meetings are being held. These meetings will include an upcoming call with national federations later this week. The outcome of these meetings will be detailed in a press release to be published on 4 November.” The former British modern pentathlete Kate Allenby, who won a bronze for Team GB at the Sydney Olympics, told the Guardian any move to replace riding would be a “disaster” for the sport. “This needs talking about because it’s not modern pentathlon if it hasn’t got riding in it,” she said. However another British Olympian Greg Whyte, who also won a world silver medal in 1994, said he could understand the change. “I don’t think it is necessarily a bad thing,” he said. “Back in the day, the fencing part alone used to take 14 hours, while in Paris the whole event will last just 90 minutes. All sports evolve, and no sport is immune from change in the modern TV era.” Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

The UIPM is understood to have acted after the sport was heavily criticised in Tokyo. The German competitor Annika Schleu, who had been in the gold-medal position before the showjumping, was seen in tears after her ride, Saint Boy, refused to jump over the obstacles. The German coach Kim Raisner, who was seen punching Saint Boy, was sent home from Tokyo and the UIPM promised to conduct a full review as well as disciplining Raisner.

Activists blame the near-total abortion ban introduced by Poland’s constitutional court last year for her death. Conservative commentators and politicians, however, have rejected such suggestions. “Sometimes women die in childbirth,” said an MP from the ruling party. “It certainly has nothing to do with any decision of the [Constitutional] Tribunal.” Although the woman died in late September, her case was made public only last week when Jolanta Budzowska, a lawyer representing the family, published information and a statement from the family on social media. Konsekwencje wyroku TK z 20.10.2020 r., sygn. K 1/20 w praktyce. Pacjentka 22 tydz., bezwodzie. Lekarze czekali na obumarcie płodu. Płód obumarł, pacjenta zmarła. Wstrząs septyczny.

Doctors confirmed that the foetus lacked amniotic fluid and severe foetal defects were detected. According to the statement, Iza was in touch with her family and friends during hospitalisation and informed them that the doctors had decided to “refrain from emptying the womb until the foetus died”. She linked their decision to the near-total ban on abortion introduced last year, which made abortions due to birth defects illegal. Soon after the foetus died, Iza herself also died due to septic shock. One of the last texts she sent reportedly said: “My fever is going up. I hope I won’t get sepsis or I won’t get out.” The family notified prosecutors, who will investigate whether Iza received appropriate medical care and if her death was a consequence of malpractice. The health minister has also ordered an audit of the hospital in Pszczyna where the incident took place. Meanwhile, women’s rights groups organised silent protests around Poland yesterday on All Saints’ Day, when millions of Poles traditionally leave candles at the graves of family members. Activists called Iza “the first victim of a near-total abortion ban in Poland” and yesterday’s demonstrations took place under the slogan “Not a single one more” (Ani jednej więcej). “If she had received help in time, she could have survived,” said Kamila Ferenc, a lawyer from Federa, a women’s rights group. 🕯🖤 Yesterday, all across Poland silent commemoration took place for a woman who died of septic shock. She was 22 weeks pregnant. The doctors had not performed an abortion – even though the fetus was fatally ill. We stand with you in this difficult moment.#anijednejwiecej pic.twitter.com/e3BbSCFWHc — Terry Reintke (@TerryReintke) November 2, 2021 However, the hospital sees it differently. “At the time the patient was admitted, the symptoms of the inflammation were not developed to an extent to undertake any hysterical moves,” explained its director, Marcin Leśniewski, quoted by TVN24. In a further statement today, the hospital said that all its actions were “guided by concern for the health and life of the patient and the foetus”. While they “share the pain of all those affected by the death of our patient”, they urged “a fair and honest” investigation into its causes. Regarding whether the abortion law played a role in the death, the hospital simply stated that “all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland”, reports Gazeta.pl. But Budzowska, the family’s lawyer, told Onet that “the effect of the Constitution Tribunal ruling is indisputable”. She says that doctors are now afraid that their actions could result in prosecution. However, Jerzy Kwaśniewski, head of ultraconservative legal group Ordo Iuris, which supports restrictions on abortion, has argued that the situation in Pszczyna is unrelated to the constitutional court’s ruling. “The law does not forbid saving a life,” he notes, adding that doctors and experts he has spoken to do not consider the lack of amniotic fluid as posing a threat to the life of the mother. Under the current abortion law, terminations are still permitted in the case of a threat to the mother’s health or life. However, Ferenc says that doctors “are waiting until the last moment to use this backdoor of ‘threat to life’ as they are afraid that if they opt for it too soon they will face criminal charges [from] a politically motivated prosecutor”.

Niestety wciąż czasem przy porodach kobiety umierają, to nie jest rzecz, która się nie zdarza; ale z całą pewnością nie ma to żadnego związku z jakąkolwiek decyzją #TrybunałKonstytucyjny – powiedział we wtorek Marek Suski.#aborcjahttps://t.co/zyXdf2Zk4j — Tygodnik Sieci (@Tygodnik_Sieci) November 2, 2021 On 22 October 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortions carried out due to the diagnosis of a severe birth defect in the foetus – which had previously been permitted and made up over 90% of legal terminations in Poland – were unconstitutional. The ruling only formally came into force in January. But even in November and December, doctors and activists reported a “chilling effect”, with hospitals cancelling planned abortion procedures and refusing to schedule new ones. Since then, many women’s rights groups report that it has become increasing difficult for women to obtain abortions, with the number of legal terminations – already among the lowest in Europe – falling 65% in the year since the ruling.

The US president said it was a “big mistake” that his Chinese counterpart had chosen not to attend the summit, where more than 120 world leaders have spent the last two days discussing ways to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. “We showed up,” Biden told a press conference, speaking before world leaders departed, to leave the floor to their ministers and officials for two weeks of tense negotiations. “They didn’t show up … It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away,” he said, also criticising Russia and Vladimir Putin. “How do you do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?” China delivered a plan for emissions reductions on the eve of the conference that many analysts found disappointing. Under the plan, the world’s biggest emitter would cause emissions to peak by 2030 and reach net zero by 2060, targets it had already set more than a year ago and which if not improved will make it difficult for the world to stay within 1.5C, the threshold beyond which scientists warn some of the impacts of climate breakdown will become irreversible. Earlier in the day, Biden made a point of rejoining the “high ambition coalition” of developed and developing countries that ensured the 1.5C limit was included in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, reinforcing calls for big emitters to do more to cut carbon this decade. Biden added, however, that he did not seek conflict with China and indicated he could take a softer stance if China stepped up with more measures on the climate. “This is competition, not conflict,” he said. “[Tackling the climate crisis] is an economic opportunity.” Biden’s words at his final press conference reflect a hardening stance towards China more generally at the talks, from developed countries who want the world’s second biggest economy to go further, especially on phasing out coal, and developing countries who fear the 1.5C goal will slip out of reach without action to halve emissions this decade. China’s head of delegation at Glasgow, the veteran official Xie Zhenhua, was also in a forthright mood earlier in the day, accusing developed countries of having failed the rest of the world, by failing to cut emissions fast enough and by failing to provide the developing world with $100bn a year in climate finance, which has long been promised, to help poor countries cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. China does not receive climate finance but sees itself as a champion of developing country interests. He defended China’s use of coal, saying building a limited number of new plants was necessary to bridge the gap while China updated its energy grid for more renewables, adding that the new plants were highly efficient and replaced old, inefficient plants that were being decommissioned. But he said that he had spoken extensively to John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, and to the UK’s Alok Sharma, who is president of the talks. He said those conversations had been “highly constructive”. Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “At Biden’s press conference we saw the whiplash of his rhetoric on climate in action. First he asks Opec to pump more oil, then describes his worry about the horrors of climate change. “To set his climate ambition straight, it would be profound and game-changing for him to return to Washington and declare a national climate emergency to halt crude oil exports. That’s just one of the tools Biden has to take transformative action on climate without Congress. Biden sounds just as worried as the rest of us, but he has power unlike anyone else’s. For the sake of us and the planet, he has to use it.” Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, delivered an upbeat assessment of the prospects for a deal at the conference that would keep the 1.5C goal within reach, despite having warned at the weekend that the chances were slim."

Experts from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a nonpartisan national security research and advocacy organization, found that China has made significant progress on suspected silo fields in the western part of the country. ""For China, this is an unprecedented nuclear buildup,"" wrote Matt Korda and Hans M. Kristensen, the authors of the FAS report released Tuesday. The authors noted that ""the missile silo fields are still many years away from becoming fully operational and it remains to be seen how China will arm and operate them."" However, recent reports of Chinese activities have added to concerns from US officials about China's rapid military progress. The suspected development of a first missile silo field was reported in late June. Following another report from FAS released in July on China's suspected development of a second silo field , US Strategic Command tweeted , ""This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it."" Navy Adm. Charles A. Richard, the commander of US Strategic Command, said in August that ""we are witnessing a strategic breakout by China."" ""The explosive growth and modernization of its nuclear and conventional forces can only be what I describe as breathtaking. And frankly, that word breathtaking may not be enough,"" he said. Different stages of construction underway by Chinese engineers on multiple silos at the possible Ordos missile silo field in August 2021. After clearing the space for the project, they use inflatable domes to protect the active construction on the silos. The commercial satellite images from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs analyzed by FAS offer some of the most detailed pictures yet of three suspected missile silo fields, where the Chinese appear to be constructing roughly 300 new missile silos. ""What's notable, of course, is the scale and the speed of this that this is so out of sync with what the Chinese have done on missile silos ever before,"" Kristensen told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Chinese government for comment on new report. China's ongoing development of the silos comes as the country is bolstering its military capabilities significantly. The US has said that China tested a hypersonic weapon over the summer which Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley called ""very concerning."" He also said that ""Chinese military capabilities are much greater than that"" single test. However, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the August test was ""a spacecraft, not a missile."" China has long committed to a minimum deterrence policy, meaning it keeps its nuclear arsenal at the minimum level necessary to deter an adversary from attacking. It is believed to have about one-tenth the nuclear weapons that Russia and the US have and has a no-first-use policy. JUST WATCHED China reportedly tests a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China reportedly tests a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile 03:02 A change in China's approach? Some experts and officials say recent developments raise questions about its commitment to that policy. Nicholas Burns, the Biden administration's nominee to be US Ambassador to China, said during his confirmation hearing last month that the Chinese ""are blasting past that definition (of a minimum nuclear deterrent), and they're rapidly engaged in the buildup of their nuclear arsenal, including the disturbing reports of the hypersonic technology."" Benjamin Friedman, the policy director of Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think tank, said he believes China has not fundamentally changed policy, ""but they seem to have decided that it takes a little more than it used to,"" and ""we shouldn't take the development of more missiles necessarily as a different approach on the Chinese part, it might just be that they think the same approach takes more weapons than it used to."" ""The United States has long continued to pursue a first strike capability against all nuclear adversaries -- that is the ability to have enough weapons, and nuclear weapons are most important in that, to destroy their entire arsenal in one go,"" said Friedman, adding that China probably feels ""they might need a little more insurance against the prospect of the US disarming first strike for various reasons."" Kristensen of FAS said that the construction of the silo fields ""likely has to do with the fact that the Chinese leadership has just decided that China has to be big militarily, and the nuclear forces have to match that."" He also noted that it ""reduces the vulnerability that anyone can knock them out in a surprise attack."" This graphic image shows the progression of silos under construction. Some of the silos just beginning the building progress, others in the midst of being developed under an inflatable dome and others have advanced so far that the dome has been cleared. It is unclear if the US will be able to know with certainty if these silos are filled with missiles, creating a conundrum for the US in determining how to counter or compete with China's buildup. Some experts point out that this may be part of China's strategy. ""China may fill these out eventually but in the interim, when they are not all filled out, would the US be able to distinguish with certainty which silos are filled and which aren't and would we have to commit to destroying all of these no matter what? If that is the case then the US has to commit maybe twice the number of warheads to all of the silos,"" said Vipin Narang, a professor of political science focusing on nuclear proliferation and strategy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you are the US this forces you to re-think nuclear planning,"" he said. The images in the report also reveal that China appears to be constructing other types of support facilities around the silos, Kristensen said. The report says they are almost the size of a football stadium -- to protect the silo construction area from severe environmental factors. The experts who compiled the report also noted that the shelters may have been constructed to ""hide technical details from satellites."""

REUTERS/Phil Noble/Pool Summary UK's Johnson flags 'Glasgow Breakthroughs' on green tech India's Modi says grids going to provide critical solutions U.S., UAE announce sustainable agriculture plan GLASGOW/BOSTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Britain and India introduced a plan on Tuesday to improve connections between the world's electricity power grids to accelerate the transition to greener energy. Linking the grids would allow parts of the world with excess renewable power to send it to areas with deficits. For instance, countries where the sun has set could draw power from others still able to generate solar electricity. The ""Green Grids Initiative"" at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, was backed by more than 80 countries and could set a model for how rich countries help poorer ones to reduce their emissions and meet the goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial norms. ""If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement. U.S. independent energy expert Matthew Wald said the plan underscored how renewable energy sources need more transmission lines since they must often be built far from cities, unlike coal or gas-fired plants whose fuel can be shipped in. But Wald said planners in various countries - including the former Soviet Union - have long dreamed of cheap transmission across time zones with limited progress. Although powerline technology has improved in recent years, Wald and others said the plan would require spending large sums. ""We're talking about transmission networks that will need to be undersea. They will need to cross mountain ranges. They'll need to cross deserts"" said Kartikeya Singh, senior associate at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, The official announcement of the trans-national grid plan did not include cost figures or funding details. Modi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously outlined the plan. On Monday, Modi had said India would reach net zero carbon emissions by 2070, two decades later than scientists say is needed. read more Although seen as sceptical of efforts to slow climate change, Modi has attended the conference, while leaders of other major emitters, including China and Russia, are not attending in person. read more The grids plan showed Modi willing to move the world's second-most populous nation away from fossil fuels as long as developed countries help, said Julie Gorte, senior vice president for sustainable investing at Impax Asset Management. ""Left to their own devices India is going to build coal plants,"" she said. The plan is part of a broader attempt to speed up the roll out of affordable low-carbon technology, covering more than 70% of the global economy. Announcing the first five goals of the plan, dubbed the ""Glasgow Breakthroughs"", Johnson flagged targets to push clean power, zero emissions autos, near-zero emission steel, low-carbon hydrogen and climate-resilient agriculture. The United States and the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, began an initiative, with $4 billion in backing, to help farming adapt to climate change. read more Reporting by William James and Simon Jessop in Glasgow, Scotland and Ross Kerber in Boston; additional reporting by Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, Calif. editing by Barbara Lewis and Grant McCool Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Eva Plevier AMSTERDAM, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Tuesday decided to re-impose measures, including the wearing of face masks, aimed at slowing the latest spike in COVID-19 infections, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. The use of a ""corona pass"", showing proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or recent negative coronavirus test, would be broadened as of Nov. 6 to public places including museums, gyms and outdoor terraces, Rutte said. Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have been rising for a month after most social distancing measures were scrapped in late September, and reached their highest level since July in the past week. This has forced many hospitals to cut back on regular care again, to make room for urgent COVID-19 cases. In a televised news conference, Rutte called on all Dutch, vaccinated and unvaccinated, to stick to basic hygiene rules and to stay at home if they had symptoms of a possible infection. ""Our own behaviour is crucial, a very large part of our coronavirus policy depends on it,"" the prime minister said. Face masks will be reintroduced in stores and other public places, while people are advised to work at home for at least half of the time. The government next week could decide to broaden the use of the corona pass to the workplace, Rutte said. Dutch health authorities on Tuesday recommended COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for older adults. Around 84% of the Dutch adult population has been vaccinated. As of Tuesday, new infections were up nearly 40% week-on-week to more than 300 infections per 100,000 people, approaching peaks previously seen in July 2021, and in December and October 2020. read more The strain on hospitals is an immediate concern, as the country's National Institute for Health said on Tuesday admissions are up 31% in the past week, with unvaccinated patients accounting for most hospitalisations. Among people testing positive in the past month, about 52% say they were unvaccinated, while 45% say they were fully vaccinated, according to RIVM data. Earlier on Tuesday the country's Health Council recommended that fully vaccinated adults aged 60 and older should begin receiving a booster shot.

Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica announced on Tuesday the creation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR) initiative, which would both join and increase the size of their protected territorial waters to create a fishing-free corridor covering more than 500,000 sq km (200,000 sq miles) in one of the world’s most important migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks and rays. The move comes amid growing clamour for action to protect rare marine species and commercial fish populations against foreign fishing fleets exploiting the region’s rich marine biodiversity, as well as to limit illegal, under-reported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by local fishing communities. The president of Colombia, Iván Duque, announced an additional 160,000 sq km of marine protected area on top of the country’s existing 120,000 sq km at Cop26 in Glasgow on Tuesday. The day before, Ecuador’s president, Guillermo Lasso, took the first step by announcing the expansion of the current 133,000 sq km Galápagos marine reserve by 60,000 sq km. “Just as all the world leaders here have called for action not words, I believe this is a concrete action on behalf of Ecuador that goes beyond any words we can say here,” Lasso told the Guardian after the announcement. “This is a sovereign decision of the Ecuadorian government but I have to point out that it is the result of five months of dialogue, which we’ve held with small-scale and industrial fishermen. For that reason I don’t expect any problem of rejection or protest because it is a consensual decision,” he said. Lasso added that the plan for a wider joined-up reserve was “an absolutely direct response of middle-income countries with a commitment to humanity” to the increased presence of industrial fishing fleets. He said the expansion involved one of the world’s largest debt swaps for conservation, but did not give any details or figures. The expansion creates a “safe swimway” connecting Ecuadorian with Costa Rican waters, where “important endangered migratory species, such as sharks, whales, turtles and manta rays travel”, said Ecuador’s environment minister, Gustavo Manrique. “In spite of the fact we’re a developing country, despite the fact we have [one of] the largest [fishing] fleets in the Pacific, we have decided to reduce the fishing effort,” Manrique told the Guardian.

Never have countries with connecting maritime borders joined together to create a public policy.” This new Galápagos protected area would be split into two: a no-take zone of 30,000 sq km to the north-east of the Galápagos Islands connecting Ecuador’s waters with those of Costa Rica, along the underwater seamounts of the Cocos Ridge, a key migration route for ocean-going species. Another 30,000 sq km area is a no-longline fishing zone wrapping north-west around the existing Galápagos marine reserve. Alex Hearn, a British marine biologist who has worked in the Galápagos Islands for two decades, said it was a step forward. “This is a moment to relish, but there’s a lot of work which needs to be done.” Hearn said the eastern tropical Pacific was “one of the last bastions of what ocean biodiversity would look like in a pristine world”, and described the seas that connect the Galápagos, Malpelo, Cocos and Coiba islands as a living laboratory for scientific research. “Just protecting the waters around them is not enough. There’s a connectivity between the areas and that’s what we need to protect,” he said. Hearn noted that the populations of highly migratory species had been falling this century, among them turtles, rays and sharks, particularly the critically endangered hammerhead species that congregates to breed around the Galápagos’s Darwin and Colombia’s Malpelo islands. In June, as part of the UK-led “30x30” initiative to secure at least 30% of the world’s ocean as protected marine areas by 2030, Panama more than quadrupled the Cordillera de Coiba marine protected area – from about 17,220 sq km to 98,230 sq km. Max Bello, an ocean policy advisor with the NGO Mission Blue, said: “With this commitment, Latin America again consolidates its leadership in marine conservation, but more is needed. We are hoping to continue towards at least 30% of protection in all of the [maritime] countries.” “A new era – to provide protection to species which know no frontiers – has been born,” he said."

The man, identified only by his surname Li, allegedly sent the meme on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, in a group exchange complaining about the local Covid-19 prevention and control measures late last month, according to authorities and state media. China maintains an uncompromising zero-Covid policy that has resulted in officials reimposing lockdowns and other emergency measures in recent weeks in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Police in Qingtongxia city, in Ningxia region, posted a screenshot of Li's text exchange on Chinese social media, but later removed the post. State-run outlet The Paper published further details of the incident that has provoked consternation in China, with a related hashtag garnering 170 million views. Many protested Li's punishment, arguing that use of an internet joke was hardly grounds for being detained by police. According to The Paper, Li sent a meme showing a dog in a police hat, holding a police badge and pointing at the camera. It's a common image that has been used widely online before, with different variations sometimes including a cat or cartoon character in the police hat. On Saturday evening, local police received a tip from a member of the public, alleging that Li had sent an image ""insulting the image of police,"" according to The Paper. The police launched an investigation into the chat group, which had more than 330 members, according to The Paper. After finding that Li was ""dissatisfied with the community prevention measures,"" police summoned Li to the station, where he was questioned and eventually ""confessed to the illegal fact of insulting the police."" Police said his actions had constituted the offense of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble,"" and gave him nine days' detention as punishment. The Paper praised local authorities' efforts in containing the virus. The police are ""on the front line of epidemic prevention and control to build a safety barrier for people's lives and health,"" said the article. ""However, there are some people dissatisfied with the epidemic prevention measures, and even openly insulting the police,"" the article added. ""For such illegal acts, Qingtongxia Police Department always insists on 'zero tolerance' policy and resolutely punishes them according to the law to defend the authority of law enforcement and legal dignity of the police."" China has some of the world's strictest Covid-19 measures, including travel restrictions, snap lockdowns and mass testing. This is in contrast to other countries in Asia, which are learning to live with the virus after rolling out mass vaccinations. These measures, though broadly popular inside of China, have also prompted rare signs of public resistance in recent weeks as virus case numbers increase. Two residents were detained in October for trying to climb over the fences of their locked-down gated community. And on social media, some residents have begun complaining about the toll of being locked down for extended periods of time, and the damage it has caused to local economies."

The declaration came as Joe Biden accused the government of “gross violations of internationally recognised human rights” and said he that he was removing Ethiopia from a key US trade program, clearing the way for further economic sanctions over its failure to end the nearly year-long conflict. Jeffrey Feltman, the US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, warned that the US would take further measures against the Abiy government within days rather than weeks if it does not end the conflict. He said “We can proceed down one path that inevitably leads to sanctions and other measures or we can go down another path where we can revitalise the partnership that started when prime minister [Abiy Ahmed] took office. The US wants the latter.” “Prolonging the war, dodging genuine negotiations to lead to de-escalation and a ceasefire, and refusing unhindered humanitarian access to avert catastrophe are actions that are taking Ethiopia [in] a dangerous direction,” he said. The announcement of the state of emergency came two days after the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods. The state of emergency was imposed after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it was considering marching on Addis Ababa, about 380km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions. The city administration said people should register their weapons and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said. “Residents can gather in their locality and safeguard their surroundings,” it said. “Those who have weapons but can’t take part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over the weapon to the government or their close relatives or friends.” The governments of four of the country’s 10 regions also called upon Ethiopians to mobilise to fight against the Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said. On Monday night, Tigrayan forces said they had linked up with fighters from an Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are Ethiopia’s biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders are currently in prison. The conflict in what was once considered a stable western ally in a volatile region has plunged about 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in the north to flee their homes. Speaking in Washington, Feltman said the US was seeing signs of famine and near-famine and that it was mostly government restrictions that were preventing humanitarian help from getting to people. He said: “It is not too late to retrace our steps towards the path not taken but the change in direction must occur in days not weeks. It requires the Ethiopian government to take steps we have been raising for months’’. He said he was willing to travel at any time to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to mediate and secure a peace deal with the TPLF. Feltman said there were “credible and repeated stories of looting, displacement, executions, reports of rape and sexual violence as a tool of war” in which all factions were implicated to some degree. He said that the US will be encouraging “international justice and accountability against those responsible for the horrors they have imposed on the Ethiopian people”. He added “the Ethiopian people who have suffered are going to want to see some kind of justice and reckoning for the horrors they have been through due to this needless conflict.” The conflict started over the night of 3 November 2020, when forces loyal to the TPLF – including some soldiers – seized military bases in Tigray, a northern region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there. The TPLF had dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 after years of anti-government protests. When he first came to power, Abiy enacted significant political reforms but rights groups say many of those freedoms have since been rolled back. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2019 for ending a long-running border conflict with Eritrea. Troops from Eritrea, whose president is an arch-enemy of the TPLF, later entered Tigray to support Ethiopian forces."

Munch three or four and you may catch a head rush that some describe as euphoric. Until recently, nibbling any amount of kratom in Thailand was punishable by a stint in jail — and selling more than 10 kilos could bring on years in prison. But as of late August, the leaf is fully legalized, with vendors selling it alongside everyday veggies at outdoor markets. Related: Amid narcotics reform, Thai cooks replace MSG with cannabis The mild narcotic is still finding its niche in Thailand’s commercial landscape. Niks Anuman-Rajadhon, a mixologist and bar owner in Bangkok, is at the vanguard of reinventing kratom’s image. “Kratom has been labeled as a poor man’s drug. ... During tests or exams, we’d have kratom from time to time to help us concentrate.” Niks Anuman-Rajadhon, mixologist and bar owner, Thailand A cocktail infused with the kratom leaf. Credit: Patrick Winn/The World “Kratom has been labeled as a poor man’s drug,” Niks said. To most, the leaf evokes the image of a hard-laboring farmer in Thailand’s sweltering far south, chewing a few leaves to make the day go easier. Niks first got his hands on kratom during his student days. “During tests or exams,” he said, “we’d have kratom from time to time to help us concentrate.” Now he is hoping the drug can keep his business alive. For much of the pandemic era, bars have been shut by government decree and even restaurants have been forbidden from selling alcohol. The virus has eviscerated Thailand’s food-and-beverage sector. But then came the legalization of kratom, which caught many by surprise. Kratom-related convictions have been wiped from the criminal records of more than 10,000 Thais; another 1,000 or so were freed from prison. Sensing opportunity, Niks has invented kratom-infused cocktails. Instead of gin and tonics, his award-winning bar Teens of Thailand makes kratom drinks with mango foam, garlic brine, coconut syrup and other ingredients. His mixology team has experimented with distilling kratom extract through a variety of methods, one involving a sous vide machine. Niks said chewing on a leaf “OG-style” lends a taste that is “very green, like a chlorophyll flavor, and quite bitter.” It also numbs the gums. “But if you mix it right, it’s actually quite pleasant.” Since the 1980s, Thailand has been the United States’ top ally in Asia in the war on drugs. But in recent years, its government, despite a right-wing bent, has started to veer in its own direction. Related: Human rights activists hope international court will help end Duterte's deadly war on drugs in the Philippines Methamphetamine, the most popular illegal drug, will not be legalized anytime soon. But milder drugs, such as cannabis or kratom, both indigenous to Asia, are getting a second look. Cannabis oil is now readily prescribed from traditional medicine centers for ailments ranging from cancer to insomnia (though cannabis buds remain illegal.) Kratom leaves are far less regulated — as legal as celery — though Thai authorities have yet to allow the mass production of kratom extracts. Extracts (finely ground kratom leaves) do have a niche consumer base in the US, where kratom is legal in all but six states. Having first slipped under the radar as a health supplement, kratom is loosely regulated in the US. Kratom’s popularity in the US has coincided with the onset of the opioid crisis in the 2010s. This is no coincidence. Some Americans addicted to opioids — especially high-potency fentanyl — have discovered that using kratom can help them wean off. Kratom can be addictive, as well. For heavy users, the withdrawal is quite nasty. Ingesting extreme amounts can reportedly cause an overdose. But kratom fatalities are extremely rare; a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of more than 27,000 overdose deaths found only seven in which a person reportedly died from kratom use alone — and even in those cases, “the presence of additional substances cannot be ruled out.” Related: Minerals, drugs and China: How the Taliban might finance their new Afghan government Still, the threat of a US federal ban looms over kratom. There were attempts to ban it coming from officialdom — namely the Federal Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Agency — in both the Barack Obama and the Donald Trump presidencies. More recently, congressional lawmakers from both parties have urged the Joe Biden administration to keep kratom legal. Thailand’s legalization of kratom stands to save $50 million — the cost of arresting and confining offenders. Thai entrepreneurs are already making money off kratom home delivery. Some upscale supermarkets sell the leaves in their produce sections. In rural markets, the equivalent of $8 buys half a kilo or many dozens of leaves. The sensation of kratom is a bit hard to describe. In mild doses, it brings on a feeling of serenity — though the effect is subtle. “It kind of erases a lot of noise in the background,” Niks said. “It makes you feel more clear.” Everything in moderation, he said. Even after Thailand allows bars to serve alcohol — possibly in December — Niks intends to keep kratom-infused cocktails on the menu."

Ethiopia’s cabinet has declared a nationwide state of emergency effective immediately and authorities in Addis Ababa told citizens to prepare to defend the capital, as fighters from the northern region of Tigray threatened to march towards the city. “The state of emergency is aimed to protect civilians from atrocities being committed by the terrorist TPLF group in several parts of the country,” state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting reported on Tuesday, referring to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which has been fighting the federal government for a year. The six-month state of emergency allows, among other things, for roadblocks to be established, transport services to be disrupted, curfews to be imposed and for the military to take over in certain areas. Anyone suspected of having links with “terrorist” groups could also be detained without a court warrant, while any citizen who has reached the age of military service could be called to fight. “Our country is facing a grave danger to its existence, sovereignty and unity. And we can’t dispel this danger through the usual law enforcement systems and procedures,” Justice Minister Gedion Timothewos told a state media briefing. He said anyone violating the emergency would face three to 10 years in prison, for offences such as providing financial, material or moral support to “terrorist groups”. The move came after the Tigrayan fighters said they had captured the strategic towns of Dessie and Kombolcha in the neighbouring Amhara region in recent days, and also indicated they might advance further south, on Addis Ababa. The government said soldiers were still battling for control for the two key towns, some 400km (250 miles) from the capital. Much of northern Ethiopia is under a communications blackout and access for journalists is restricted, making battlefield claims difficult to verify independently. Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their weapons in the next two days and prepare to defend the city.   Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into Tigray in November 2020 in response to what he said were attacks on army camps by the TPLF. The TPLF said the federal government and its allies, including Eritrea, launched a “coordinated attack” against it. Abiy promised a swift victory, but by late June, the Tigrayan fighters had regrouped and retaken most of the region. Fighting has since spread to the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara. On Tuesday, the US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman denounced the TPLF’s expanding military campaign. “We have consistently condemned the TPLF expansion of the war outside Tigray and we continue to call on the TPLF to withdraw from Afar and Amhara,” said Feltman. “The expansion of the war however is as predictable as unacceptable given that the Ethiopian government began cutting off humanitarian relief and commercial access to Tigray in June which continues to these days despite horrifying conditions of reported widespread famine,” he added. Separately, the US government said on Tuesday it would revoke trade privileges to Ethiopia, including duty-free access to Ethiopian exports, due to “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights”. The move dealt a new blow to Ethiopia’s economy, which is already under pressure from the growing cost of the war and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The conflict has triggered a humanitarian crisis that has left hundreds of thousands of people facing famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 2.5 million people forced to flee their homes."

The dimensions of the central solenoid magnet stir the imagination: its height is 17.9 m, width 42 m and weight about 1000 tons. It took General Atomics (GA) specialists more than 5 years to create it. However, this is only half of it. Transporting it to its destination will also be a momentous task. A marvel of engineering According to GA Design Director John Smith, the magnet’s power will be enough to lift an aircraft carrier weighing 101,250 tons to a height of nearly two meters. The central solenoid will consist of six modules weighing 112.5 tons each. Scientists are going to use it to create a powerful magnetic field of 15 million amperes, which will hold the plasma heated to millions of degrees inside the fusion reactor. The first crucial component needed to transport it is a unique crane. The crane body is placed on a nine-axle truck. The other parts and components of the crane will be in 40-60 semi-trailers. The module will be shipped by rail to Houston, Florida, and from there by sea to France. How the magnet is made Its main components are niobium and tin. Cables are shipped from Japan to GA, where they are carefully coiled and heat-treated for five weeks at 650 °C. The result is the Nb3Sn alloy, which is a superconductor. After the heating, the temperature is maintained for some time, after which the gradual cooling begins. A special machine covers the cooled coils with insulation. The total length of the cable is 5.6 km. The first of six modules has already arrived in France. It is currently sitting in the port. It will be delivered to the site where ITER is being assembled by the end of autumn. Evolvera – Tech, startups and futurism in the new era"

In the text, two days before the announcement of the Aukus security partnership and the cancellation of a major French contract to supply submarines to Australia, Macron asked Morrison whether he could expect good or bad news on the submarines. Its publication came after Macron told reporters he “knew” that Morrison had lied to him over plans with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines. Morrison rejected the claim and said he was “not going to cop sledging of Australia”. French media described the text message leak as “spectacular and extremely rare”, saying it appeared to be aimed at demonstrating that Macron had already been informed the contract might not go ahead even before it was torn up. But the Elysée official insisted the text showed rather that Macron “did not know what stage the discussions had got to” just two days before Australia called off the A$90bn (£49bn) deal for 12 conventionally powered submarines. A second French government source told Agence-France Presse that if a message existed that clearly showed that Macron did in fact know, “they would have reported that instead”. The source added: “We knew the Australians had some issues, but they only concerned technical aspects and the timetable, as with every big contract.” It was precisely those issues that the text message referred to, ahead of a discussion with submarine manufacturer Naval Group planned for the following day, the source said. It is not clear what response Morrison gave to the message. The Elysée also rejected Canberra’s account that it made multiple attempts to contact Paris to warn of the impending announcement. The official told Le Parisien only one phone call had come through to the palace, at 11am on a Wednesday – during Macron’s weekly cabinet meeting. “It is difficult to believe that the Australian prime minister has not been advised of this constraint,” the official said. “He knew very well the president was unavailable.” It was later that same day, the adviser said, that Paris had learned that the contract was being rescinded and that a press conference was to be held during the afternoon. “It’s a curious way of going about things,” the Elysée source told Le Parisien. “France was left with no opportunity to respond or to come up with a counter-proposition, which we had the means to do. Once again, it is not the choice that we denounce – that’s a sovereign decision. It’s the way of doing things.” The Elysée also said that Morrison could have sought a reconciliatory meeting with Macron in recent days, at the G20 meeting in Rome or the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. “The president was waiting for a proposition from the prime minister, which did not come,” the source said. Morrison spoke with Macron by phone last week, and the French president used that call to urge the Australian government to propose concrete steps to repair the relationship. Morrison insists that he “made very clear” to Macron at a dinner in Paris in mid-June “that a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia’s strategic requirements”. But the Australian prime minister also said he wasn’t at liberty at that stage to disclose to Macron that Australia would work with the US and the UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, because those plans had not yet been finalised and were held “in confidence”."

The 85-year-old Blatter and 65-year-old former France international Platini now face a trial within months at federal criminal court in Bellinzona. “This payment damaged Fifa’s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini,” Swiss federal prosecutors said in a statement. The case from September 2015 ousted Blatter early as Fifa president and ended the campaign by Platini, the then Uefa president, to succeed his former mentor. It centres on Platini’s written request to Fifa in January 2011 to be paid backdated additional salary for working as a presidential adviser in Blatter’s first term, from 1998 to 2002. Blatter authorised Fifa to make the payment within weeks. He was preparing to campaign for re-election in a contest against Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar, where Platini’s influence with European voters was a key factor. Both Blatter and Platini have long denied wrongdoing and cited a verbal agreement they had made, now more than 20 years ago, for the money to be paid. Blatter has been charged with fraud, mismanagement, misappropriation of Fifa funds and forgery of a document. Platini has been charged with fraud, misappropriation, forgery and as an accomplice to Blatter’s alleged mismanagement. Platini was not placed under formal investigation until last year, and months later the more serious allegation of fraud was included against both men. Prosecutors had opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September 2015 ahead of a police raid at Fifa headquarters in Zurich on the day he and Platini attended a meeting of the governing body’s executive committee."

The announcement came two days after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods. read more The state of emergency was imposed with immediate effect after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it might march on Addis Ababa, about 380 km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions. ""Our country is facing a grave danger to its existence, sovereignty and unity. And we can’t dispel this danger through the usual law enforcement systems and procedures,"" Justice Minister Gedion Timothewos told a state media briefing. He said anyone violating the emergency would face three to 10 years in prison, for offences such as providing financial, material or moral support to ""terrorist groups"". Ethiopia last imposed such a measure in February 2018 for six months ahead of the transition of power to Abiy. Curfews were enforced and people's movements restricted, while thousands of people were detained. The Addis Ababa city administration said people should register their weapons and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said. ""Residents can gather in their locality and safeguard their surroundings. Those who have weapons but can't take part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over their weapons to the government or their close relatives or friends."" Before the announcement, people moved around the capital as normal. ""I will try to buy food commodities in advance. But so far I haven't yet purchased anything,"" said one woman who asked not to be named. The governments of four of Ethiopia's 10 regions also called upon Ethiopians to mobilize to fight against the Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said. The conflict in what was once considered a stable Western ally in a volatile region has plunged around 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in the north to flee their homes. It erupted in the night of Nov. 3, 2020 when forces loyal to the TPLF - including some soldiers - seized military bases in Tigray, a northern region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there. The TPLF had dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 following years of anti-government protests. Relations with the TPLF soured after they accused him of centralising power at the expense of Ethiopia's regional states - an accusation Abiy denies. TOWNS CAPTURED TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda said that if Tigrayan forces and their allies succeeded in removing the government, they would establish an interim government. ""If the government falls, we will definitely have an interim arrangement."" There would also need to be a national dialogue, he said, but Abiy and his ministers would not be asked to take part. ""They will have their day in court,"" he said. The TPLF has claimed the capture of Dessie, Kombolcha and Burka, all in the Amhara region, in recent days. A government spokesperson disputed the capture of Dessie and Kombolcha but later released a statement saying TPLF ""infiltrators"" had killed 100 youths in Kombolcha. Spokespeople for the government, military and the Amhara region did not return calls seeking further comment on Tuesday. On Monday night, Tigrayan forces said they had linked up with fighters from an Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are Ethiopia's biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders are currently in prison. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is ""extremely concerned"" by the latest developments in Ethiopia, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. ""The stability of Ethiopia and the wider region is at stake,"" Dujarric said. U.S. ALARM The U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa said on Tuesday Washington was alarmed by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the north, including signs of famine, and urged all sides to find ways to de-escalate and let aid in. Also on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration accused Ethiopia of ""gross violations of internationally recognised human rights"" and said it planned to remove the country from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade agreement which gives it duty-free access to the United States. Ethiopia's trade ministry said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the U.S. move and called for a reversal by January. ""The Ethiopian government takes all human rights allegations seriously: we are looking at them and conducting investigations and we are committed to ensuring accountability,"" it said.

The USS Connecticut, a Seawolf-class fast attack submarine, hit the then-unidentified object in international waters in the South China Sea on Oct. 2, resulting in moderate to minor injuries. At the time, the Navy did not specify how much damage the vessel suffered. The sub was able to power its way to a port in Guam by traveling on the ocean's surface. An investigation found that the Connecticut ""grounded on an uncharted seamount,"" the 7th Fleet said in a statement. It added that the fleet's commander will now weigh ""whether follow-on actions — including accountability — are appropriate,"" implying that human error might have somehow played a role in the submarine's crisis. A seamount near Guam was blamed for a submarine collision in 2005, when the USS San Francisco hit an uncharted seamount, resulting in numerous injuries and one death among the crew. Researchers believe more than 100,000 seamounts rise more than 1,000 meters (about 3,300 feet) from the seafloor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Most seamounts were formed by undersea volcanoes. They're common in oceanic basins, but only a small fraction of the world's seamounts have been explored. The habitats they create are seen as biological hot spots, hosting a wide range of marine life. ""New estimates suggest that, taken together, seamounts encompass about 28.8 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface,"" NOAA says. ""That's larger than deserts, tundra, or any other single land-based global habitat on the planet."""

The Prime Minister will make the 400-mile flight south due to 'time constraints' that mean he cannot use the direct train route between the two cities, a spokesman told reporters. Mr Johnson is due to return to the capital when the leaders' conference section of the summit ends this week. He today told world leaders at the start of the COP26 summit that they can no longer afford to delay taking major action to address climate change as he warned 'the longer we fail to act, the worse it gets'. He said the world has 'long since run the clock down on climate change' and there is now just 'one minute to midnight', with action required immediately to prevent a global disaster. But after his speech, his spokesman told reporters he would fly back to London using a private charter powered by a special mix of 'sustainable' aviation fuel. He said it is one of the most carbon-efficient aircraft of its size, while the emissions will also be offset. Pressed on why the Prime Minister could not go by train for a journey within the UK, the spokesman said it was important he was able to travel round the country while facing 'significant time constraints'. It came after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' £48million Gulf Stream led a 400-strong parade of private jets into COP26 including Prince Albert of Monaco, scores of royals and dozens of 'green' CEOs - as an extraordinary traffic jam forced empty planes to fly 30 miles to find space to park. Mr Johnson today told world leaders at the start of the COP26 summit that they can no longer afford to delay taking major action to address climate change as he warned 'the longer we fail to act, the worse it gets'. He flew into Glasgow on Sunday night after attending the G20 in Rome at the weekend and will fly back to London later this week Amazon airways: Jeff Bezos' Gulfstream private jet - which reportedly cost him £48million - arrives at Prestwick Airport near Glasgow on Sunday Mr Johnson's charter aircraft produces less than half the emissions produced by the RAF Voyager which the Prime Minister sometimes uses for foreign travel. But its use will embolden critics who say there is one set of rules for the global rich and another for everyone else, amid efforts to cut global air travel to cut emissions. 'Our approach to tackling climate change is to use technology so that we do not have to change how we use modes of transport, rather we use technology on things like electric vehicles so that we can still get to net zero,' the spokesman said. 'That has very much been at the core of our approach. Joe Biden lands at Edinburgh Airport on Air Force One this morning. He will generate an estimated 2.2 million pounds of carbon during his trip to Europe 'It is important that the Prime Minister is able to move round the country and obviously we face significant time constraints. 'The plane the Prime Minister used on his travels is one of the most carbon-efficient planes of its size in the world. It produces 50 per cent less CO2 emissions than, for example, the larger, Voyager plane. 'It uses a specific type of fuel that is a blend of 35 per cent sustainable aviation fuel and 65 per cent normal fuel, which is the maximum amount allowed.' Mr Johnson used the aircraft, operated by Titan Airways, to fly out to the G20 summit in Rome on Friday and then carried on to Glasgow on Sunday. The disclosure came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced accusations of hypocrisy when he announced a cut in air passenger duty on short-haul flights and a further freezing of fuel duty in his Budget last week, just days before the opening of Cop26. On Sunday, MailOnline observed at least 52 private jets landing at Glasgow - while estimates put the total number flying in for the conference at 400. Conservative predictions suggest the fleet of private jets arriving for COP26 will blast out 13,000tonnes of carbon dioxide in total - equivalent to the amount consumed by more than 1,600 Britons in a year. Mr Bezos met Prince Charles this week to discuss climate change. He tweeted: 'The Prince of Wales has been involved in fighting climate change and protecting our beautiful world far longer than most. We had a chance to discuss these important issues on the eve of #COP26 — looking for solutions to heal our world, and how the @BezosEarthFund can help' Prince Charles was among those travelling by non-commercial plane from the G20 in Rome. Mr Bezos - who regularly lectures the world on climate change - arrived in Glasgow fresh from celebrating Microsoft founder Bill Gates' 66th birthday on a £2million-a-week superyacht off the coast of Turkey in an event that generated fresh claims of green hypocrisy. He reached the boat by helicopter, according to reports. Joe Biden touched down in Edinburgh today while Germany's Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of France arrived at Glasgow. President Biden alone will generate an estimated 2.2million pounds of carbon to reach the summit, thanks to a fleet of four planes, the Marine One helicopter and an enormous motorcade including The Beast and numerous SUVs."

The army “has been designed to conduct operations at every level of combat from counterinsurgency to mechanized warfare,” Jane's analysis reported. “It is usually the first to receive the latest equipment and is also seen as the primary formation for the testing of new equipment and tactics.” A high-resolution satellite imagery shows self-propelled artillery and other equipment in Yelnya, Russia. | Satellite image ©2021 Maxar Technologies The deployment “marks a clear deviation from the 1st Guards Tank Army’s standard training pattern,” which normally takes place around Moscow, Jane’s said. Tensions have been increasing between Moscow and the West over the past several months, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has bristled at fresh talk of Ukraine and Georgia possibly joining NATO, and as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited both countries in October. While in Kyiv, Austin was asked about Ukraine’s bid to join NATO. He stopped short of an endorsement, but said Ukraine “has a right to decide its own future foreign policy,” and the U.S. will “continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine's efforts to develop the capability to defend itself,"" he added. Days later, Putin issued his reply during a speech in Sochi, warning that “formal NATO membership may never happen,” for Ukraine, “but military expansion on the territory is already underway, and this really poses a threat to the Russian Federation, we are aware of this.” The Washington Post first reported on the troop buildup on Saturday. That story referred to satellite photos but did not publish them. Reuters later quoted Ukraine's defense ministry denying the Post report, saying that as of Monday, transfer of more Russian soldiers, weapons and equipment to Ukraine’s border “was not recorded.” The pictures come as tensions continue to percolate between Kyiv and the Kremlin. This spring, a buildup of Russian troops at Ukraine’s border caused concern in Ukraine’s capital and in Washington. The administration put together a package of lethal aid for the country but then, as a meeting between President Joe Biden and Putin neared, chose not to send it. A high-resolution satellite imagery shows troop tents and an administrative area in Yelnya, Russia. | Satellite image ©2021 Maxar Technologies Some of those Russian forces would later return to their bases, but left much of their equipment behind in staging areas, another in a long history of surges and retreats along the Ukrainian border. “We are aware of public reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine but cannot speak to Russian intentions,” said Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth. “We continue to support de-escalation in the region and a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. As we’ve said, our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering.” In a show of support, Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky late this summer — a meeting that Ukrainians had long sought. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that the Biden administration will “continue to monitor the situation closely.” Russia has also been locked in a diplomatic confrontation with NATO. In the weeks before the annual NATO defense ministers’ conference last month, the alliance expelled eight Russian diplomats it labeled as spies. Moscow responded by shutting down its entire NATO mission. “There are different ways with which Russia is interfering with our neighbors, and indeed we are extremely concerned,” Nathalie Loiseau, European Union parliamentarian and head of the security and defense subcommittee, said Monday during her visit to Washington. “You will always have Europeans seeing the Russian threat as a very immediate threat for our continent.”"

The governments of the UK, US, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands are leading the $1.7bn (£1.25bn) funding pledge, which is being announced as part of ambitious global efforts to reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, with campaigners cautiously hopeful that this conference of the parties (Cop) could be the first to properly champion indigenous peoples’ rights. Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador’s indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said: “We are happy with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to transform a system that has directed less than 1% of climate funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what happens next. “This Cop is interesting and unprecedented,” he added. “After attending these climate events for years, this one is different. The UK has put tremendous effort into raising our visibility at this Cop. “But the UK is now at a crossroads: they can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local communities.” As indigenous peoples have fought for their rights more publicly in recent years, they have faced increasing persecution. In 2020, a record number of people were killed for protecting their land, with more than a third from indigenous communities. Despite the important role they play in protecting forests, only a small fraction of these communities have secure rights to their land. The funding is recognition that IPLCs are crucial to protecting tropical forests and preserving ecosystems. Leaders will be calling on other countries to respect and protect these rights in accordance with national legislation. While the majority of the money in the fund will come from governments, charitable foundations including the Ford Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Arcadia, Wyss Foundation and the Rainforest Trust are contributing more than $600m. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, said the aim was to give IPLCs more of a voice in policymaking and discourse. It is hoped more funding will follow. Walker said: “It’s a first step, it’s a down payment. We ignore these communities at our peril. We have to invest more, we have to support them more. “I’m not asserting that this is the only solution,” he added, “but it’s a critical part of the puzzle of solving climate change and this part of the puzzle needs to be resourced properly.” The money will support IPLCs’ capacity to govern themselves collectively, assist with mapping and registration work, back national land reform and help resolve conflict over territories. It will continue until 2025. Walker said: “We have been wedded to technical, market-based solutions, and have ignored the communities right in front of us who are key to solving the challenge. “This is an historic moment. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the paradigm and to at last give power and a seat at the table to the people who are critical to the solution. A new paradigm is emerging and we will hear it loud and clear in Glasgow.” The announcement follows a number of studies that show securing indigenous rights and land tenure is an effective way of protecting the environment. A 2021 UN review of more than 300 studies found that deforestation rates in South America were up to 50% lower within areas under indigenous control than elsewhere. It follows an emphasis on including indigenous voices at the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference in Marseille in September. For the first time in its seven-decade history, the IUCN included indigenous peoples as full voting members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category. Paul Redman, founder of If Not Us Then Who?, a US charity that highlights the role indigenous and local peoples play in environmentalism, said: “I think it’s the first time in all the climate conferences I’ve been to since 2013 that leaders really seem to be genuinely engaged and wanting indigenous peoples to be at the table. “The real key is follow-up: money going to indigenous communities and land titles being allocated to indigenous peoples post-Cop.”"

Fredy López Arévalo, a veteran reporter in the southern state of Chiapas, was shot in the head inside his home in the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas on Thursday. López had covered Central American politics and the Zapatista uprising for news organisations such as Reuters, the Los Angeles Times and Notimex, and he still reported on the local political situation. On the same day, Acapulco journalist Alfredo Cardoso was pulled from his home by masked gunmen who also threatened his family. He was found the next day having been shot five times, and died from his injuries in hospital on Sunday, according to press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders. Cardoso previously worked as a photojournalist in Acapulco, a city which was once the jewel in the crown of Mexican tourist destinations but has been a hotbed of drug cartel violence for more than a decade. More recently he was the manager of the online news site Revista Dos Costas. “The situation for journalists in Acapulco and all of Guerrero [state] has worsened,” said Bernandino Hernández, a photojournalist in the coastal city. “Journalists have been threatened, some have had to flee. It’s a really dicey situation,” he said. No suspects have been arrested for either crime. Crimes committed against Mexican journalists almost always wallow in impunity – the product of inept and inadequate investigations, a lack of political will to stop the killings of media workers and frequent collusion between drug cartels. The two attacks reinforced Mexico’s reputation as the most murderous country for journalists in the hemisphere. The country’s murder rate has steadily risen since the then president Felipe Calderón declared a militarized crackdown on drug cartels in 2006. In the same period, attacks on journalists have also skyrocketed. Analysts say those most at risk are reporters who cover the intersection between local politics and the drugs trade. “These murders take place within a context of continuously deteriorating security in the country, for all citizens, but particularly for human rights defenders and journalists,” said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “These attacks are fueled by impunity, which is almost complete in crimes against the press. The government of [President Andrés Manuel] López Obrador has been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to strengthen the justice state or protect journalists.” Mexico recorded 36,773 homicides in 2020, in spite of the pandemic and quarantines, according to the state statistics service INEGI – slightly higher than the 36,661 homicides registered in 2019."

A new report from UN agencies estimates that some 23m of the country’s 38m people will not have enough food to get through the winter unless aid is rapidly scaled up. The crisis has been a long time coming. Drought and war had already left many destitute. The fallout from covid-19 lockdowns squeezed household finances further. Since the Taliban took over the country in August, the economy has collapsed. The UN estimates that half the country was living on less than $1.90 a day when Kabul fell. By the middle of 2022, that may rise to 97%. “We’ve not seen this level of near universal poverty in any country in recent history,” said Kanni Wignaraja of the UN Development Programme on October 21st. The immediate reason for the crisis is the loss of foreign aid, on which the Afghan economy previously depended. Before the Taliban took over the country received around $8.5bn a year, which was two-fifths of its GDP . Three-quarters of the government’s budget was paid for by foreign donors, including almost all of health and education. The central bank also relied on regular cash injections from abroad. All that ended on August 15th, when the previous government fled the country. Aid payments were suspended and the country’s $9bn in foreign reserves was frozen to prevent the Taliban from getting their hands on it. The government’s hefty wage bill, which included salaries for 220,000 teachers, has since gone unpaid. With no dollars being shipped in, the hard currency needed to purchase foreign goods has dried up. Fear of sanctions has largely halted transactions related to foreign trade in any case. Foreign correspondent banks, which provide currency exchange and help with money transfers, are cutting their links to Afghan banks. They worry that they will be punished for dealing with the new regime, many members of which are under UN sanctions. The currency is in free fall; basic necessities are scarce; inflation is rising. Because much of the economy is informal, it is hard to know precisely how bad things are. Informal money transfers and the black market may be taking some of the strain. Yet many people are apparently unable to afford even bare necessities. Kabul residents have taken to selling their possessions by the roadside to buy food. The IMF estimates GDP may contract by 30% in the coming months. There is little hope that things will get better soon. The Taliban, who this month somehow found the money to hold a reception celebrating their suicide-bombers, seem to have no plan to tackle the disaster other than to blame it on foreigners. Afghanistan’s former backers, meanwhile, are turning their attentions elsewhere. Despite pledges made at a recent donor conference in Geneva, aid plans are only one-third funded. Moreover, says Robert Mardini, the boss of the Red Cross, “no humanitarian organisation can...replace the economy of a country.” Attitudes towards the regime, which shows little sign of keeping its promises to form an inclusive government or respect women’s rights, are hardening. Having allowed the Taliban to take over the country, Western leaders look set to observe its economic collapse from afar.■"

Sir Patrick Vallance said the planet cannot rely on a 'magic' technology to solve the climate crisis. He made the comments as he joined international scientists urging leaders to limit global warming to 1.5C. Sir Patrick Vallance (pictured) said the planet cannot rely on a 'magic' technology to solve the climate crisis. He said he wants green choices to be the 'easy choice' Sir Patrick said he wants green choices to be the 'easy choice' because they are convenient and affordable, but said people can make a difference at an 'individual level'. He said: 'A little bit of reduction in the amount of meat you eat, deciding not to fly as often. 'Those things individually, of course, are trivial impacts at the individual level, but they are huge when you aggregate them across millions and millions and millions of people. 'So I think the behavioural change part of this is really important.' Almost 40 scientific leaders signed a statement ahead of the Cop26 climate talks, saying it was still possible to keep temperature rises to 1.5C – beyond which point the more severe impact of global warming would be felt. This is only said to be possible with steep reductions in emission by 2030, and net zero carbon use by 2050. The Government's chief scientific adviser said tackling the climate crisis could be as simple as eating less meat and not flying so often (file image of Heathrow Airport) The advisers say stabilising the climate would limit sea level rises and extreme weather events, improve prosperity and protect human health and nature. The statement says limiting warming 'will require rapid, urgent and sustained action and significant behavioural, socioeconomic and technological transformations across the world'. Sir Patrick said 'the green choice needs to be the easy choice'. 'If there's too much of a barrier to do something, you won't get the mass change that needs to take place,' he added. 'For the green choice to be the easy choice, there are a number of factors in that, including of course price – because if things don't come at an affordable level, then it's impossible for people to do it or there's a barrier for people to do it. And it needs to be convenient.'"

Such a huge climatic shift, brought the tropospheric Polar Vortex to shift south by many degrees compared to today.","https://www.severe-weather.eu/cryosphere/polar-vortex-south-shift-powerful-climatic-event-trigger-ice-age-to-begin-rrc/",23,"severe","The Polar Vortex South Shift is Such a Powerful Climatic Event to Trigger an Ice Age to Begin, and Already Happened Some Tens of Thousands of Years Ago","2021-10-26 21:22:14-05","New research finds the global average temperature at 7.8°C (46°F) during the last glacial maximum with a polar vortex shifted south by many degrees of latitude compared to today. The consequences on the global cryosphere due to cold conditions were dramatic and impressive, and able to freeze on continental ice masses tens and tens of meters of sea level. Today, the worse winter conditions we face in terms of cold temperature due to the polar vortex south shift, are basically those that were normal during the last glacial maximum. In recent years, the term polar vortex is no longer used exclusively by professional meteorologists, but by the general public as well. Often, the term polar vortex is used a bit abusing it, but it is certainly something that attracts people’s attention. The polar vortex variability, in fact, is the main trigger of the greatest cold waves affecting the U.S. and Europe. But what is the polar vortex? THE POLAR VORTEX  In meteorology, the polar vortex is a semi-permanent low pressure located just above the North Pole. It is a large region of rotating, cold air that encircles both polar regions. Several meteorologists consider the polar vortex to be no more and no less than the mean zonal flux at high latitudes. This structure, flowing around the Earth, gives rise to a vortex (closed isobars, approximately circular and concentric) when viewed by an observer located just above the Arctic. The polar vortex might be seen as a semi-permanent stable cold circulation pattern describing two distinct phenomena: the stratospheric polar vortex, and the tropospheric polar vortex. The stratospheric polar vortex is a large-scale baric structure especially active in the cold, winter season. High-speed cyclonically rotating winds are located between roughly 15 kilometers and 50 kilometers high. The stratospheric polar vortex strengthens and extends in the autumn and shrinks and fills in the spring. In summer, the polar vortex is practically absent as its autumn genesis is due to the cold air forming in the surrounding arctic areas.  The original version of the image above source NOAA is available at EcoWatch article. The tropospheric polar vortex is instead often defined as the area poleward of the tropospheric jet stream, extending from the ground up to about 10-15 kilometers. Unlike the stratospheric polar vortex, the tropospheric polar vortex exists all year round. Temporary events can jeopardize its existence. For example, the development of lobes that cause it to shatter towards the mid-latitudes could cause intense cold outbreaks in Europe or the U.S. Until the seventies, the concept of polar vortex was replaced by the simpler and more generic one of the polar front. The polar front ideally separates the arctic cold air from milder sub-tropical air of the mid-latitudes. The term polar front is inherited from the Norwegian meteorological school. The video above is a mosaic animation by NASA/JPL-Caltech The low-pressure area can be imagined as a large top at high altitude with a counterclockwise circulatory motion, centered on the vertical of the North Pole. On the other hand, in the troposphere, the prevailing baric regime is of high pressure. The higher the rotation speed and the more intense the vortex, the lower the probability of polar cold outbreaks towards mid-latitudes. If the polar vortex weakens, the jet stream tends to be more meandering. This allows the arctic cold air to drop suddenly in latitude affecting North America or Western Europe. Sometimes the stratospheric vortex deepens downwards triggering a tropospheric vortex and the two baric figures can feed each other.  Above, an image courtesy of NASA showing the typical jet stream meandering A measure of the intensity of the polar vortex is given by the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In turn, the Arctic Oscillation has close links with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The North Atlantic oscillation is a teleconnection index depending on differences in the atmospheric pressure between Iceland and the Azores islands. In the Pacific Ocean, The North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is an oscillation of atmospheric pressure and sea-surface temperature in the North Pacific Ocean. NPO affects, among other things, winter temperature over most of North America. The NPO is similar to the NAO in having a low-index state and a high-index state. A low NPO index is associated with southerly winds along the west coast of North America, which tends to bring warmer air into the region. A high NPO index brings a northerly airflow, with the corresponding movement into the region of cold, sub-polar air.  The figure above is courtesy of J. Wallace, University of Washington) from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre1. Among meteorological enthusiasts, the polar vortex is a meteorological and climatic structure to be kept under control all the time. In particular, for example, when sudden stratospheric warmings are in effect, the polar vortex is destabilized. In a few weeks from the sudden stratospheric warming, arctic air tends to be advected at great speed towards southern latitudes. This leads to cold outbreaks with very marked negative temperature anomalies. The main issue, however, is linked to the fact that when sudden stratospheric warming occurs, we are almost sure there will be a spill of cold Arctic air towards the southern latitudes. Anyway, it is difficult to know what the precise target of the cold will be.  The image above shows an example of the cold outbreak that occurred in February 2021 Very often, the primary target is represented by the U.S. Occasionally, such cold outbreaks affect Western Europe. Practically, a shift of the polar vortex to the south, as occurred on many occasions in the past, brings Europe and U.S. back to the similar normal conditions that should have been in place during the last glacial maximum. THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM  Last Glacial Maximum refers to the most recent time during the Last Glacial Period when ice sheets were at their greatest extent. The image below shows the ice sheets and glaciers distribution reconstructed for the Last Glacial Maximum in the northern hemisphere. A recent study by Jessica Tierney and others (she is an associate professor at the University of Arizona Department of Geosciences), and published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature, calculated how was the most likely global average temperature during the last glacial maximum, about twenty thousand years ago. The research team used models that connected data from ocean plankton fossils to sea-surface temperature. This technique is called data assimilation, used in weather forecasting, and was employed to link the fossil data with climate model simulations of the last glacial maximum. Basically, what normally happens in a weather office is they measure the temperature, pressure, humidity and use these measurements to update a forecasting model and predict the weather. In this case, scientists used the Boulder, Colorado-based National Center for Atmospheric Research climate model to produce a hindcast of the Last Glacial Maximum. Then, they updated this hindcast with real data to predict what the climate was like.  The original image above is available in Nature article. More, the team of scientists calculated the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity. Climate Sensitivity is a measure of how much the Earth’s climate will cool or warm after a change in the climate system. For example, how much it will warm for doubling in carbon dioxide concentrations. The equilibrium climate sensitivity has been calculated at 3.4°C (6.1°F). Carbon levels during the Ice Age were about 180 parts per million, then rose to about 280 parts per million during the Holocene (the last interglacial), and have by now reached 419 parts per million. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the calculated Earth’s temperature with this method was most likely 7.8°C (46°F). The decrease, compared to the pre-industrial period (1850), equals to -6.1°C (-11°F) with a maximum probability range between -5.7°C and -6.5°C. The global average temperature of the 20th century was 14°C. The current average temperature of the Earth is now close to 15°C.  The image above shows the locations of the proxies used for the Last Glacial Maximum reconstruction. The original is available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2617-x Nowadays, with global warming in effect, some areas of the planet are affected differently by climate change, mainly due to feedbacks. For the same reason, the Arctic areas of the planet cooled twice as much during the Last Glacial Maximum and had a temperature about 14°C lower than today. Like the arctic areas, mountain areas are also climatic hot spots. The European Alps, for example, probably cooled by around 10°C compared to pre-industrial values. The decidedly colder climate led the planet’s cryosphere to react, obviously in a direction completely opposite to what is happening today. The ice sheets expanded and new ones formed. In Northern Europe, the Eurasian Ice sheet covered Scandinavia, part of Northern Europe, and part of the British Isles up to Ireland.  The image above shows the calculated summer temperature drop in the Mediterranean and the Alps during the last ice age, by Kuhlemann and others, Science. Calculations are derived from reconstructed ELA. To know better what the ELA is, you can follow this link and read a recent article about the ELA Central Europe was entirely affected by frozen ground and permafrost which, in some cases, reached hundreds of meters of depth. The Eurasian ice sheet is estimated to have had a maximum ice thickness of about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet). Even today, due to the weight of this enormous ice mass, Scandinavia is reacting with the phenomenon of isostasy. The Scandinavian continental part, that is, continues to rise slowly especially in its central area where the ice sheet was thicker.  The image above shows the Eurasian ice sheet extent at the LGM credits Svendsen and others (2004) The same thing happened in North America. Here, the North American Ice Sheet was almost 3 kilometers (2 miles) thick and covered North America from the Canadian Arctic all the way to the modern U.S. state of Missouri. The North American Ice Sheet pushed south to about the latitude of Seattle, Bismarck, Madison, and New York. A lobe close to the U.S. East coast dropped in latitude to the cities of Indianapolis, Columbus, and Pittsburgh.  The original image above is available at this link from Nature But it was the very presence of the large ice sheets that further changed the general global circulation, as well as the extent of sea ice. In the Atlantic Ocean, the sea-ice surrounded all of Greenland and Iceland. Instead, the seasonal sea-ice reached as far as the coasts of France and sometimes northern Spain. In the Pacific Ocean, sea-ice entirely surrounded the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. A vast landmass, called Beringia, linked Siberia to Alaska. In particular, recent Italian research by Giovanni Monegato and others published in the scientific journal Nature’s Scientific Reports explained how the growth of the North American Ice Sheet between 26 thousand and 24 thousand years ago led to a further drop in the polar front to the latitude of northern Spain. This has contributed to the growth of glaciers in the European Alps thanks to precipitation increase. The moisture entered the Mediterranean from the west thanks to the south shifted polar front, feeding in that way the alpine glaciers. In the video below the animation of temperature variation and glacier response over the European Alps from 100 thousand years ago up to the present day. The original video is available by Seguinot et al. following this link https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/12/3265/2018/ Then, the subsequent modification of precipitation and currents led to a slight rise of the polar front towards the north which allowed the Eurasian Ice Sheet to enlarge and reach its maximum size between 23 thousand and 17 thousand years ago. The image below, explains precisely what we just described. Before this work, the thousands-years-time lag when the two main ice sheets reached their maximum size during the Last Glacial Maximum, had not yet been explained properly  The original Image above is available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02148-7 WHAT CAUSES AN ICE AGE  The causes of the ice ages are well known and linked in particular to astronomical forcing. Variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession resulted in cyclical variation in the solar radiation reaching the Earth. These orbital forcings strongly influence the Earth’s climate patterns. Wavering periodically give rise, when their effects are in phase, to glaciations every 100 thousand years. The Earth’s axis completes a precession cycle every 26 thousand years. The elliptical orbit completes one cycle every 22 thousand years. Furthermore, the angle between the Earth’s axis and the normal of the orbital plane varies periodically between 22.5° and 24.5°, with a period of 41 thousand years. The combined effects of these three types of orbital cycles affect the amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth in different seasons, especially at high latitudes. With cold weather, snowfalls of course increase during the ice age. More, summer ablation is also greatly reduced. The consequence is that snowfalls fail to melt in the short summers characterized by a polar front much further south. This causes massive amounts of freshwater to freeze in continental ice. An ice age, in the end, helps remove part of the water of the atmosphere from the Earth’s hydrological cycle. The most direct consequence is a global sea-level lowering. In the image below you can see in red the areas of land that emerged during the Last Glacial Maximum in Europe. Therefore, the polar vortex is a meteorological and climatological structure so well known today. It certainly makes thousands of weather amateurs dream about it. But at the same time it makes millions of people fear about it, due to the extreme cold, snow, blizzards it brings with it. The polar vortex, in the past, represented a fundamental element in modulating variations of the Earth’s climate history and reacted, as well, responding to changes in climatic parameters. In particular, the last 2.56 million years have been characterized by a sequence of recursive ice ages and shorter interglacial periods. Today, we are lucky enough to be able to taste from time to time what the average conditions might have been during the Last Glacial Maximum. We can experience short-time ice-age conditions thanks to the polar vortex south shift. The polar vortex is able to bring to our home, in a short time, the typical conditions the Earth was facing 20 thousand years ago.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which rendered useless the government-issued electronic cards that many Iranians use to buy subsidized fuel at the pump. It bore similarities to another attack months earlier that seemed to directly challenge Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the country's economy buckles under American sanctions. Those economic problems worsen as the U.S. and Iran have yet to jointly re-enter Tehran's tattered nuclear deal with world powers.

While ISNA didn't acknowledge the number's significance, that number is associated with a hotline run through Khamenei's office that handles questions about Islamic law.

State TV said Oil Ministry officials were holding an “emergency meeting” to solve the problem. Some gas stations that accept only cash and are not in the subsidy card network continued pumping fuel. The use of the number “64411” mirrored an attack in July targeting Iran's railroad system that also saw the number displayed. Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point later attributed the train attack to a group of hackers that called themselves Indra, after the Hindu god of war. Indra previously targeted firms in Syria, where President Bashar Assad has held onto power through Iran's intervention in his country's grinding war. Cheap gasoline is practically considered a birthright in Iran, home to the world’s fourth-largest crude oil reserves despite decades of economic woes. Subsidies allow Iranian motorists to buy regular gasoline at 15,000 rials per liter. That’s 5 cents a liter, or about 20 cents a gallon. After a monthly 60-liter quota, it costs 30,000 rials a liter. That’s 10 cents a liter or 41 cents a gallon. Regular gasoline costs 89 cents a liter or $3.38 a gallon on average in the U.S., according to AAA. In 2019, Iran faced days of mass protests across some 100 cities and towns over gasoline prices rising. Security forces arrested thousands and Amnesty International said it believes 304 people were killed in a government crackdown.

Liberal sources told CBC News that Guilbeault, who has worked with groups such as Equiterre and Greenpeace, will be moved to the crucial portfolio from his previous post as heritage minister. His appointment comes just days ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow (COP26), which will draw leaders from around the world — including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — to discuss the climate crisis. Harjit Sajjan, who has been serving as national defence minister amid a growing sexual misconduct crisis in the military, is also expected to be among those headed to new jobs when Trudeau reveals the makeup of his next cabinet Tuesday. Liberal sources tell CBC News they are expecting a significant cabinet shuffle that will include the heads of multiple senior portfolios. Health Minister Patty Hajdu, who took on that job just months before the pandemic, will also be moved to a new job. There are plans to add a second junior minister to the health portfolio. What to expect from Trudeau’s new cabinet 1:58 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s new cabinet is expected to include gender parity, regional distribution and a new minister of defence. 1:58 Two to three current ministers are expected to be dropped from the cabinet entirely, sources also say. The next cabinet will be sworn in Tuesday morning during a ceremony at Rideau Hall. Trudeau has said the cabinet will have both gender parity and what he has called ""proper regional distribution."" Chief Political Correspondent Rosemary Barton will have full coverage of the swearing-in of the Trudeau cabinet on Tuesday starting at 9 a.m. ET on CBC News Network, cbc.ca, CBC Gem and wherever you stream CBC News. At least one senior minister will be keeping her job. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland has agreed to remain in both roles, Trudeau has said. Justin Trudeau has had only one defence minister in his six years as prime minister: Harjit Sajjan. That's expected to change when his new cabinet is revealed. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) While Sajjan will no longer oversee the embattled Department of National Defence — now embroiled in a sexual misconduct crisis in the military's leadership — he is expected to remain in cabinet with a new portfolio. Sajjan, a former lieutenant-colonel in the army, has been minister of defence since 2015. The Conservatives and NDP have called for his resignation over accusations that he has failed to respond to the military's sexual misconduct problems. Trudeau is expected to select a woman as Canada's next defence minister. Anita Anand, the current minister of public services and procurement, is considered a top candidate for the job. Former prime minister Kim Campbell is the only woman ever to serve as Canada's defence minister. She held the title for the first five months of 1993. Anand has raised her profile while leading Canada's vaccine procurement efforts during the pandemic. Time for some new faces? Sources say Sean Fraser, who has represented Central Nova since 2015 but has never served in cabinet, is likely to be among those named to cabinet tomorrow. Marci Ien, the former CTV journalist who now represents Toronto Centre, and Randy Boissonnault, who reclaimed the riding of Edmonton Centre after a defeat in 2019, are also seen as top prospects for cabinet. Pascale St-Onge, elected in Brome—Missisquoi, is considered one of the few rookies with a chance at nabbing a minister's role. St-Onge recently worked as a union leader in Quebec's cultural sector. Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland will remain in both roles, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) The last version of the Liberal cabinet had 37 ministers, including Trudeau. When Trudeau took office in 2015, he named a cabinet of 35 people. The cabinet was shuffled last on Jan. 12, 2021. Trudeau's commitment to gender parity and the loss of four women ministers may necessitate several of the changes expected to be revealed tomorrow. Ministers Maryam Monsef, Bernadette Jordan and Deb Schulte were all defeated in the recent election. Catherine McKenna, who most recently served as minister of infrastructure and communities and was former environment minister, did not seek re-election. Other changes are also on the way for senior staffers in the prime minister's office. Marjorie Michel and Brian Clow each become deputy chief of staff to the prime minister. Michel, who was the Liberal Party's Quebec director of operations during the 2019 and 2021 campaigns, will lead office operations, outreach, human resources and public appointments.

The UN Environment Programme's (UNEP) latest annual emissions report exposes the gap between what countries have promised and what should be done to achieve the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5C. It finds each country's action plans - known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) - only knock 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, but 55% is needed to meet the 1.5C goal. Beyond 1.5C, more severe impacts of climate change kick in, from extreme weather to rising sea levels. Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP said we have eight years to ""make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly."" ""Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem,"" she said. Advertisement It comes just as Australia commits to net zero by 2050 and China sets out its plan to peak carbon emissions by 2030. The Emissions Gap Report also found the world is facing at least 2.7C of heating this century based on the latest climate promises for 2030. Next week leaders will meet for climate talks at COP26, which aims to ""keep 1.5°C alive"". Overshooting these goals will lead to ""a destabilised world and endless suffering, especially among those who have contributed the least to the [greenhouse gas] emissions in the atmosphere,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""We are nowhere near where science says we should be,"" Espinosa said. However, net zero commitments may offer a glimmer of hope, as they could curb heating to 2.2°C, but only if they were ""made robust and if 2030 promises were made consistent with the net zero commitments"" the report said. Subscribe to ClimateCast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or Spreaker. But it warns net zero pledges are still vague, incomplete in many cases, and inconsistent with most 2030 NDCs. It found the latest NDCs from some G20 countries were no better than their previous offering - such as Australia, Brazil and Mexico - or so unambitious that they further policy action, like Russia's. Caterina Brandmayr, head of climate policy at Green Alliance, warned net zero targets are ""only the first step, and must urgently be translated into concrete actions, particularly by G20 nations"". ""COP26 must provide a clear route forward to accelerate emission reductions and ensure countries continue to ramp up their near term climate action,"" said Brandmayr. Bleak climate report shows colossal challenge facing COP26 The prime minister's comment yesterday that success at the COP climate summit in Glasgow is ""touch and go"" was not a throwaway remark. Today's Emissions Gap Report spells out, in the starkest of terms, just how far away the UN-led process is from delivering its aim of preventing dangerous levels of climate change. It estimates the carbon-cutting commitments that countries are bringing to Glasgow currently put us on a trajectory for 2.7 degrees of warming by the end of this century. That level of warming would lead to extremely dangerous extremes of weather and climate endangering food and water supplies, wipe many low-lying nations off the map due to several metres of sea-level rise (although this would take centuries more), not to mention obliterating most of the world's glaciers and killing our existing coral reefs. The report also lays bare the colossal challenge of how much we need to change. Click here for Tom Clarke's full analysis Piers Forster, climate change professor at Leeds University, said the report paints ""an overly bleak picture"". He said: ""It is true that the 2030 emissions gap remains but if you look at their numbers, it shows that the gap in longer term emission targets is almost closed. ""These national plans show that the costs of action are far less than the cost of inaction, so we have it all to play for at [COP26] to close these gaps even further."" The report also highlights ways to slash emissions quickly, including by tackling the lesser talked about greenhouse gas methane through technology and diet changes.

Published by Oxford Economics, the Housing Affordability Indices (HAIs) report finds that ""affordability deteriorated in nearly all U.S. and Canadian metros"" in the second quarter of 2021 as ""home price inflation outpaced income growth."" Particularly, metropolitan areas along the Pacific coast were among the least affordable. Report authors note that Canada's housing market worsened in the second quarter and that trend is expected to continue. A typical Canadian home costs 35 per cent more than the borrowing capacity of median income households. ""The index has risen 10 pts over the past year, as sharply higher prices dominated the effects of lower mortgage rates and higher incomes,"" reads the report. Vancouver was the least affordable of all North American housing markets. However, the assessment finds that ""housing continues to be more affordable in the U.S. than Canada."" In fact, eight of nine Canadian cities saw affordability worsen in the second quarter. Vancouver also saw its affordability worsen the most out of all North American housing markets. Montreal was second worst, followed by Toronto. Ottawa was the fourth worst, while Hamilton rounded out the top five. And, while report authors expect that house prices will plateau, they ""expect rising mortgage rates will weigh heavily on affordability.""

The report analyzes the updated national climate plans — known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) — of 120 countries. The NDCs are at the core of the Paris Climate Agreement. All signatories are required to set national climate targets and regularly report on both their implementation and new targets. The name of the UNEP's latest report says it all — and its findings are sobering. With the updated NDCs, greenhouse gas emissions will only see a reduction of 7.5% by 2030. But in order to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius/2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (compared to 1900 levels), greenhouse gases would have to fall by 55%. 'The clock is ticking loudly' In other words, the world must cut its emissions by 28 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) per year by 2030. To limit emissions to 2 C, countries would still have to reduce their climate-damaging emissions by 30%, or 13 GtCO2e. ""To be clear: we have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the UNEP, wrote in the report. If, however, countries just stick to their own national climate targets, which they are allowed to set individually under the Paris Agreement, the world is on track for a temperature rise of 2.7 C. ""That would result in catastrophic climate change that we would not be able to cope with at all — that must be avoided at all costs,"" said Niklas Höhne, director of the Cologne-based nonprofit research organization New Climate Institute and professor of climate protection at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Pandemic was a missed opportunity The UNEP report expressed disappointment that investments designed to stimulate the economy after the coronavirus pandemic had barely taken climate protection into consideration. According to the report, less than one-fifth of recovery packages are likely to contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 5.4% drop in new emissions worldwide. At the same time, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a new high, according to a report from the World Meteorological Organization, the UN's weather and climate agency. Compared to the previous year, the increase was even higher than the average rise over the past decade, the report said. Or, as the UNEP puts it: ""CO2 concentrations are higher than at any time in the last 2 million years."" Natural greenhouse gas sinks, like the Amazon, can help offset emissions Net-zero targets bring hope According to the UNEP, the net-zero pledges made by a host of countries, including the United States, Japan, China, as well as the European Union, could make a significant difference. Net zero means that for all of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans, the same amount must be removed from the atmosphere. Artificial and natural greenhouse gas sinks, such as peatlands or forests, can be offset against greenhouse gases emitted. ""If made robust and implemented fully, net-zero targets could shave an extra 0.5 C off global warming, bringing the predicted temperature rise down to 2.2 C,"" the UNEP report says. It is critical, however, of the fact that many countries are not planning to start working toward net-zero until after 2030. An extreme world — even with a 2 C increase Countries need to link long-term net-zero targets to their ongoing NDCs and move forward quickly, UNEP Executive Director Andersen urged in the report's foreword. ""This can't happen in five years. Or in three years. This needs to start happening now,"" she said. Even if global warming were stopped at 2 C, Niklas Höhne of the New Climate Institute said the world would be a changed place. ""We are currently at a temperature increase of 1 C. And we're seeing droughts, forest dying, floods — like in [Germany's] Ahr Valley — and fires all over the world. An increase of 2 C means, as a first approximation, twice as many floods, twice as many extreme weather events."" Livestock farming is just one of the ways methane is released into the atmosphere Potential in methane, carbon markets The UNEP report sees another opportunity to close the gap between climate targets and the current reality, through the reduction of methane emissions. Methane not only escapes during the extraction of fossil fuels, but is produced during the decomposition of organic waste, in the treatment of wastewater and through livestock farming and rice cultivation. Though methane only lingers in the atmosphere for 12 years compared to up to centuries for CO2, it is much more potent and therefore significantly more harmful to the climate during its relatively short lifespan. As such, a rapid reduction of methane emissions could limit temperature rise faster in the short term than a drop in CO2, according to the report. Mechanisms such as compensation payments to poorer countries or clearly defined and properly designed carbon markets could also lead to countries taking more ambitious climate protection measures, the UNEP authors wrote. ""We are so late to climate action that it is imperative that developed countries, in addition to efforts at home, help developing countries reduce emissions as quickly as possible. The emissions gap is so large that no country can sit back,"" Höhne said. This year's Emissions Gap Report highlights not only failures but also the enormous potential for more climate action, wrote UNEP's Andersen. For example, policies implemented between 2010 and 2021 will lower annual emissions by 11 GtCO2e in 2030 compared to what would have happened without them. Though she said ""we should not despair,"" she also called on the world to ""wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. We need to go firm. We need to go fast. And we need to start doing it now."" This article has been adapted from German"

The Animal Rights Index, which ranked 67 countries based on different factors, found that Luxembourg was the best, followed by the UK in second place - and that China was bottom of the table. 12 In June, we exclusively revealed dogs and puppies were taken to 'secret slaughterhouses' in China 12 Many were shocked to see bears and other animals forced to perform in Russia Credit: Darren Fletcher - The Sun Countries were given a score based on metrics including the recognition of animals as sentient creatures, meat consumption rates and fur bans. Among the worst offenders were Vietnam, Belarus and Iran. Matthew Nash, 42, who conducted the study for insurance company The Swiftest, told The Sun that the nations who “scored poorly” had an “overall lack of any protections for animal rights”. He added: “Just the basic recognition of animal suffering and creating laws against animal cruelty would be a huge step in the right direction. “These countries had very limited protected areas for animals leaving the wilderness areas open for mass exploitation which naturally displaces and harms wildlife.” In the wake of this new index, we look at shocking stories of animal abuse that have emerged from the worst 10 nations. '10 million dogs killed for meat' Location: China Animal Rights Index score: 12.46 out of 600 Despite implementing new legislation that meant pets could not be raised as livestock in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it appeared some abuses are still going on in China. Back in June, we exclusively revealed that the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival returned where visitors can buy a whole dead dog for as little as £100. The animals, often stray or stolen pets, were rounded up and taken to “secret slaughterhouses and farms” where they were drowned, burned to death with a blowtorch or bludgeoned. Say No To Dog Meat told The Sun that up to 1,000 dogs – including puppies – had been killed each day for the event in plots not far from the festival. PETA believed between 10 and 20 million dogs were killed for their meat each year in China. And it's not just dogs that are suffering - tigers have been raised in captivity by criminal gangs who charge rich people tens of thousands of pounds for products made out of their bones. The big cats were kept in tiny cages and often injected with water to increase their size before being butchered and stewed in giant urns. Traders peddle lies including that tiger bone products cure coronavirus and help men’s sexual performance – but others buy it to showcase their wealth. China has no animal rights protections whatsoever... Matthew Nash, The Swiftest An adult tiger can be turned into 12 blocks of tiger bone glue – which sells for £500 per 100gram piece – meaning criminals make around £60,000 per slaughter. Other animal products such as rhino horn and pangolin scales can be bought from wet markets to be used as part of traditional Chinese medicine. However, not everyone agrees with the trade in China and a new wave of young protesters are opposing the sales of these types of products. Matthew told The Sun: “China has no animal rights protections whatsoever and they have excessive pesticide usage… the highest per hectare of any country... on our list of 67. “They also scored poorly with the percentage of protected areas and on their environmental performance index.” 12 Tigers were discovered to have been trafficked as part of the tiger bone trade Credit: BBC 'Supermarket for wildlife' Location: Vietnam Animals Rights Index score: 45.24 out of 600 The southeast Asian country was also implicated in the illegal trade of tiger products - but it seems more has been done to combat it in recent years. In 2017, the nation was described as a “supermarket for wildlife” by the Wildlife Justice Commission and since then there has been a large crackdown. Interventions at the border were increased resulting in the burning of 2,253 seized ivory and rhino horns. Last year, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc pledged to tackle wildlife-based crime. Fines between £95 to £1,650 have been introduced for anyone who beats or tortures animals or pets or refuses to sedate an animal before slaughter or injects them with foreign substances. Prior to the new laws, a shocking video showed a boar being chased and then torn apart by a pack of dogs while locals watched for fun. In 2017, government pressure also led to a festival in Nem Thuong ending its age-old tradition of chopping a pig in half so that locals could dip money into its blood for ‘good luck’. 12 One boar was torn apart by a pack of hunting dogs while locals watched Credit: Animal Asia 12 In recent years, a Vietnamese festival stopped chopping pigs in half for good luck 'Unbearable cruelty' Location: Iran Animal Rights Index score: 71.4 out of 600 For several years, protesters have taken to the streets to voice their frustration over the brutal killing of stray dogs in Iran. One incendiary video from 2016, showed a dog’s head being repeatedly bashed against the side of a pick-up truck. Another clip from two years ago showed adult dogs and puppies howling in agony after being injected with a fatal liquid before they died in pain. Many have opposed the acts of animal cruelty and called for better laws to protect creatures in the country. They included an unnamed mum-of-two who told Radio Free Europe (RFE): “This cruelty is unbearable. “Why do we have to witness such behaviour? It’s against humanity and it shows that we need a law to protect the poor animals.” 12 Stray dogs found in Iran Credit: AFP 'Mass dog culling' Location: Azerbaijan Animal Rights Index score: 73.07 out of 600 Ahead of hosting the European Games in 2015, the country came under fire for culling stray dogs in their capital Baku. RFE obtained footage of older canines being shot and smaller ones whacked with a shovel, allegedly to “save the bullets”. “What the world is seeing are piles of burning dog bones and fur spewing black smoke into the air,” said PETA director Mimi Bekhechi. Azerbaijan’s Presidential Office rejected the claims and suggested it was an effort to discredit the nation. However, similar footage had previously been recorded in Baku in 2013 showing authorities dragging dogs into a van and killing others in front of children. In 2011, strays were allegedly killed in a bid to smarten up the city ahead of the nation hosting the Eurovision Song Contest. 12 In Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, animal rights activists were horrified after seeing stray pets slaughtered on the streets Credit: YouTube Stray pet 'death camps' Location: Belarus Animal Rights Index score: 105.65 out of 600 The Animal Protection Index states there is a “lack of… overall animal legislation” in Belarus but other issues affected The Swiftest ranking the country the fifth-worst for animal rights. For every one person in the country, 37.7 land animals are killed each year, which is four times more than the global average of 10.1, the Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index (VACI) reported. Chickens make up around 86 per cent of Belarus’ animal population and most of them are factory farmed for their meat. The VACI described Belarus as being a “very poor performer” for animal protections and scored them one mark higher the lowest level due to their introduction of animal health legislation in 2014. Animal rights group Goodness claimed stray pets in the city of Babruysk were being put down in “death camps” back in 2018. They complained that animals were being killed with the euthanasia drug T61, which causes immense pain, without any form of anaesthesia. At the time, Belarusian legislation did not penalise animal abuse and private organisations were tasked with clearing the streets of stray pets - rather than enforcing sterilisation programmes to prevent them from breeding. Goodness also claimed up to 80,000 homeless cats and dogs vanished from animal shelters each year. 12 A campaign was launched to prohibit the killing of stray animals Credit: Change.org 'Poisoned, beaten, shot & left to die' Location: Algeria Animal Rights Index score: 124.13 out of 600 A lack of protection laws has led to Algeria being criticised by animal rights charities a number of times over the years. In 2018, Fight Dog Meat claimed “rampant abuse against dogs” occurred in the country after seeing a number of heartbreaking videos and photographs. They claimed dogs were “poisoned, beaten, shot and left to die” and “nursing mothers” were being shot, which left “starving puppies to starve to death”. “Algerians do 'not' eat dog meat but foreign workers in Algeria are documented capturing dogs and slaughtering them for meat,” wrote Fight Dog Meat. 12 Puppies and adult dogs have been killed on the streets - and some have eaten the animals Credit: Fight Dog Meat/Facebook Dogs stolen & killed with sticks Location: Mali Animal Rights Index score: 165.88 out of 600 While there are laws against cruelty to animals in Mali, there is still some room for improvement according to The Swiftest’s report. They listed room for improvement including more protected areas to allow animals to thrive uninhibited and better environmental protection laws. Previously, a charity reported that dogs had been rounded up from villages or stolen from the streets to be sold as meat. They claimed up to 300 dogs were killed in the Ségou region alone and often the animals were beaten to death with sticks. However, the charity and other partners have intervened by offering individuals farming equipment to leave the dog meat trade. 'Sick donkeys abandoned to be eaten by hyenas' Location: Ethiopia Animal Rights Index score: 176.02 out of 600 For decades, donkeys have borne the brunt of a lack of animal rights protections in Ethiopia. The creatures play a pivotal role in everyday life there - helping to transport goods, food and water - but are not treated with respect, according to The Donkey Sanctuary. When donkeys are unable to work due to being too old, injured or suffering an infection the majority are abandoned and often eaten by hyenas, NPR reported. They claimed that between 1995 and 2015 only 185,000 donkeys were treated by vets as many professionals were not taught how to nurse the creatures back to health. This compared with two million treated by The Donkey Sanctuary. And according to the charity that’s not the only threat they face. Last year, they warned many of the animals risked being killed for their skin to be used in traditional Chinese medicine, known as ejiao. 12 One donkey was blindfolded as it was forced to pull a heavy cart Credit: Alamy 'Bear circuses & slapped whales' Location: Russia Animal Rights Index score: 207.96 out of 600 Russia is one of the very few nations left in the world where animals still perform in circuses and a number of shocking tales about abuse regularly emerge. Animal rights campaigners told the Moscow Times that allowing animals to live in an “unnatural environment” was cruel and they often suffer abuse. Other causes for concern have been witnessed at oceanariums including footage of a trainer slapping and kicking two beluga whales that didn’t perform a stunt. A source from the venue told PrimaMedia that the creatures were known for being aggressive and the trainer’s actions were an attempt to calm them down. Others denounced the “abnormal and barbaric methods” and claimed it amounted to “cruelty to animals”. 12 One trainer hitting a beluga whale in Russia caused outrage Credit: social media 'Systematic campaign to eradicate strays' Location: Egypt Animal Rights Index score: 219.39 out of 600 In January, animal rights campaigners tried to pressure the government into ending abuse towards stray cats and dogs through legislation. The groups claimed previously there was a “systematic campaign” that sought to “eradicate the stray cats and dogs in Egypt illegally”. They opposed methods used to kill the pets including allegedly poisoning and shooting them as well as exporting animal meat to some Asian countries. While killing domesticated animals in Egypt is a criminal offence this law does not extend to stray pets, The Times reported. In September, a local animal rights activist filed a complaint about a festival offering camel rides and branded it illegal under Egypt’s law. “Any activity that uses an animal in what’s called an exhibition classifies as illegal activity, animal abusive activity,” Penimah Tehilah told Fox 46. She reported it to animal control, who had received a number of complaints and visited the business before it was ruled ok by authorities. 12 PETA opposed camels being used to carry tourists in Egypt - including ones with injuries Credit: PETA Best countries and US shame In The Swiftest’s study, Luxembourg was voted the best country for animal rights with 519.68 out of 600 points. It was followed closely by the UK with 506.36 and then Austria with 501.73, Czechia with 498.66 and Belgium with 488.86. Matthew praised the UK for having “some of the lowest meat consumption levels per capita out of all wealthy western countries” as well as animal protection and anti-fur farming laws. Surprisingly, the United States was ranked the 27th worst country despite having a strong record on animal rights and anti-cruelty laws. Their position was attributed to the nation’s excessive meat consumption and other issues including no fur-farm bans, limited protected areas and animal sentience not being recognised at a federal level. The Swiftest also estimated that around 1,000 dogs and cats are put down every day because their owners do not have pet insurance. Matthew added: “As an American, I was surprised… I was under the assumption we care greatly about animals as a country. “Overall I think Americans have the misconception we are doing well in all areas of society, but we have a long way to go in terms of animal rights. “While no country was perfect, we found some like the UK and the EU, in general, tended to have more progressive laws and more favourable environments for animal welfare.” Worst countries for animal rights in 2021 THE rights of animals in 67 countries were analysed and scored based on a number of metrics - including fur farming, protection laws and recognition of animal sentience - below we reveal the lot: 1.

Communist Party leaders have much to lose by pushing back against the status quo, but many rank-and-file members demand that they do. They lament they will never make political headway if they don’t. During rallies they attempted to stage in Moscow, party members and other protesters were arrested. One veteran left-wing dissident, Boris Kagarlitsky, was jailed for 10 days for posting on social media about Communist protest rallies that he says he didn’t know were prohibited. “To be arrested, tried, and convicted for something that just didn’t happen is a new thing, at least in our times,” he says. “This kind of political repression is new and a worrisome omen for the younger generation.” Russia under President Vladimir Putin is increasingly cracking down on critics, and its newest target is the Community Party. Long tolerated as a voice of opposition in the Kremlin’s carefully crafted “managed democracy,” the Communists called out alleged electoral fraud during last month’s parliamentary elections that they said cost them several victories. Now they are facing the consequences. Boris Kagarlitsky, a veteran left-wing dissident, holds the distinction of having been a political prisoner under the regimes of Leonid Brezhnev and Boris Yeltsin. Now he can add President Vladimir Putin to that list. He’s just been released after a 10-day stint in a Moscow detention center for posting a link to a Communist Party statement alleging electoral fraud during last month’s parliamentary elections. Mr. Kagarlitsky had been in Siberia working as a political strategist for a prominent Communist candidate for the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. He returned to the capital to find that the pro-Kremlin United Russia (UR) party had swept all the city’s constituencies. That was in defiance of exit polls and votes counted at polling stations, after tens of thousands of unverifiable “electronic votes” appeared and decisively reversed results. A veritable encyclopedia on the subject of Russian electoral dirty tricks, Mr. Kagarlitsky says he has never seen fraud at this level. “What happened in Moscow was simply theft on a grand scale,” he says. “It testifies to how terrified Russian authorities are, even of the permitted electoral system that they created, that they would do this.” Why We Wrote This Political loyalties are tested when ruling parties face pressure. Russia’s Communists have benefited from the Kremlin’s carefully crafted system but are alleging fraud – and facing consequences. The independent election watchdog Golos estimates that at least 78,000 fraudulent ballots were filed through the new system of electronic voting in Moscow, denying the Communist Party (KPRF) several wins. Now the party, which has long been tolerated by the Kremlin as a voice of opposition, is fighting back. While some rank-and-file members want them to push harder if they ever want to make political headway, their nascent protesting has resulted in a decisive wave of official repression. The backlash is unprecedented in post-Soviet experience and threatens to upend two decades of Putin-era political stability. A new kind of crackdown Mr. Kagarlitsky, a well-known scholar who belongs to no political party, was arrested Sept. 30 when he arrived at the Higher School of Social and Economic Sciences, where he lectures. He was subsequently sentenced for sharing banned content on social media. He maintains he posted what he thought was a routine political critique about the voting fraud and linked to a KPRF statement that mentioned party rallies. He says he didn’t know the rallies had been prohibited by authorities. “To be arrested, tried, and convicted for something that just didn’t happen is a new thing, at least in our times,” he says. “This kind of political repression is new and a worrisome omen for the younger generation.” Russia under Mr. Putin is increasingly cracking down on critics. Over the past year, authorities have cast an ever-wider net, first arresting anti-corruption campaigner and longtime Putin rival Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned last year, and then closing down all of his political organizations. Many civil society groups have been branded “foreign agents,” some forced to close their doors. Independent media outlets have been similarly hounded. Now it appears the turn of the officially permitted opposition parties, whose different viewpoints can generate a range of debate, especially on domestic policy. Fred Weir Boris Kagarlitsky, a Russian left-wing dissident who was imprisoned for a social media post about alleged election fraud, speaks to Monitor correspondent Fred Weir on Oct. 14, 2021, at a Moscow restaurant. Until recently a Kremlin-authored system of “managed democracy” – which functions as long as the UR majority remains unchallenged and opposition parties accept their subordinate positions – has maintained a semblance of political legitimacy in the Putin era. The KPRF, with 150,000 members including 40,000 youths, is Russia’s second-largest party and the only major one with independent historical roots in Russia, while most others have been artificially created by the Kremlin. The KPRF won 19% of the votes in the September election, up about 5% from its previous tally in 2016. By contrast UR, which had been running at around 30% in national preelection polling, won around 49%, about 5% below its previous total. The KPRF claims it was robbed of several constituency victories – something that has never happened on this scale before, prompting the protests. In Moscow the party tried to organize two public rallies before they were violently dispersed. Both were declared illegal by city authorities. When the Communist Party’s Duma deputies attempted to hold a public “meeting with voters” – considered an inviolable right – about 180 activists were arrested, including six elected officials. Police laid siege to a building where the party’s lawyers were preparing a legal challenge to election results, nearly preventing them from meeting a filing deadline for their lawsuit. Nikolai Zubrilin, an elected KPRF deputy of the Moscow city council, has been arrested twice since the election and says the crackdown shows the vulnerability of authorities as more Russians begin to doubt their legitimacy. “Elections in Russia have never been clean,” he says, “but I have never seen abuses like this.” The “electronic voting” system was introduced over serious objections by the KPRF and other critics in eight Russian regions, including Moscow, shortly before the race. Authorities say that about 2 million people registered to use the system, but critics say there are no voters’ lists to corroborate that or even any means to trace the votes, much less stage a recount. “European courts have banned this type of voting as non-transparent,” says Yaroslav Listov, a newly elected KPRF Duma deputy. “Instead of some procedure that can be verified, elections have basically become an act of faith. We have absolutely no means to check the voting patterns.” The KPRF says it has launched about 250 lawsuits in connection with alleged election violations, and a coalition of losing candidates from several opposition parties is pushing for the voting system to be banned for future elections. Moscow election officials say their own investigation found no evidence of fraud, and the results have since been certified. Mikhail Lobanov was a Duma candidate for Moscow’s Kuntsevo district and supported by the KPRF. He was ahead by 12,000 votes when paper ballots had all been counted on election night. Then 20,000 electronic votes suddenly materialized in favor of his UR opponent, state TV presenter Yevgeny Popov. Mr. Popov won by 8,000 votes. “Something needs to change” Mr. Lobanov says the KPRF has been trapped by Kremlin design into a predetermined place within the existing system and, unless it moves more decisively into the streets to stage more convincing forms of peaceful resistance – as happened when millions of Russians protested against election fraud a decade ago – it will lose relevance with Russian voters. In fact, within the KPRF some members have lamented a too-passive reaction by leader Gennady Zyuganov to the results, and are pushing against their leaders’ “business as usual” relations with authorities. “If [the party] wants to survive as an opposition force, the KPRF needs to take action to maintain the trust of the people who voted for it,” Mr. Lobanov says. “That’s hard for party functionaries, who are accustomed to getting along with authorities and enjoying the perks of their jobs. But ordinary members, especially the younger ones, are getting more radical. Something needs to change.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Top-down, bureaucratic states of the type Mr. Putin has reinvented tend to collapse, often quickly and unexpectedly, he says, as has happened twice in a little over a century – after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917 and the collapse of the USSR in 1991. “The Russian public has a very left-wing orientation, so time favors the left,” he says. “The liberal opposition might have been in a position to take full advantage of the Soviet collapse 30 years ago, but they’ve squandered that opportunity. Now the KPRF, for all its flaws and hesitations, is the main repository of left-wing ideas and strong-minded left personalities on our political landscape. No wonder the authorities are reacting in such a terrified manner – much more than seems rational – to the party’s gains in the last election.”"

Sienna Senior Living, which owns Woodbridge Vista Care Community and Altamont Care Community, two long-term care homes where 84 people died altogether, is in the running to get public funds to build 223 new and 577 redeveloped beds — a move that critics say “rewards” the companies behind the deadliest homes. In a five-part series, CTV News Toronto is examining the province's decision to allocate new beds and funding to the five companies, guaranteeing their future. Click the link to read the previous installment on Southbridge Care Homes. PART 2: SIENNA SENIOR LIVING Nick Puopolo’s heart sank when he saw 10 ambulances parked outside Woodbridge Vista Care Community on one May night during the first COVID-19 wave in Ontario. He said he tried to look inside, past the glaring lights, to see if his mother was inside one of them. The long-term care home, he said, had left him in the dark for weeks and he did not know if she was even alive. The only information he said he got from the home came from personal support workers (PSWs), who would hurriedly call him and leave quick notes before hanging up, saying the situation was dire, that they needed help and that a single worker would care for 30 residents at a time. He said the staff spoke in secrecy, afraid Sienna Senior Living, the company behind the home, would punish them. “Nobody was answering our emails and phone calls for two months,” Puopolo told CTV News Toronto. “The only information we were getting was from some of the personal support workers who would call in tears and just tell us what’s happening at the home, saying they were instructed not to tell the family members anything or they would be fired.” “We planned that if nothing changed and help wasn’t brought in by the end of the week, a whole bunch of us were just going to go there and break the door down.” The Ontario government did eventually step in early June, appointing William Osler Health System as the manager of Woodbridge Vista, temporarily removing control of the facility from Sienna. The Canadian Armed Forces were also called to help. The military was already deployed in five other homes at the time, including Sienna’s Altamont home. A report offering a glimpse at what military and government inspectors found at the home only became available at the start of 2021. The home was described as unclean and in a state of disrepair due to damaged walls and flooring as well as a maintenance backlog. Inspectors confirmed incidences of neglect at the home, including delays in getting residents to hospital when sick and gaps in care related to the collection of testing swabs leading to issues in identifying infection. Inspectors also noted an incident where a resident with COVID-19 was not drinking or eating well, and yet was given a diuretic pill, which can cause people to pass more urine prompting further dehydration. The resident died days later. Inspectors reported severe staff shortages and that the home had no staffing plan. Workers said they would contact the nurse manager for extra help, but were told, “do the best you can.” Staff described nights where there was only one PSW working. Amid the chaos, inspectors say the home also hired a nurse not qualified to practice according to the College of Nurses of Ontario. The nurse was connected to a neglect case at the home. The military and province documented issues with supplies at the home, saying that, at times, staff did not have access to equipment for treatments, personal protective equipment or hand sanitizer. Some staff reported they were leaving the home because they had no access to PPE or training. Puopolo said that even before the pandemic, Woodbridge Vista did not have enough staff to care for residents. He said he hired a private personal support worker to help his mother, who has dementia, three days a week. Once the pandemic hit, he said he panicked because neither he nor the private worker were allowed to enter the home due to the outbreak. The inspection reports noted that the home failed to communicate with the families of residents and therefore they were unable to participate in the care of their loved ones, leaving them with “disappointment, helplessness, anger and frustration.” Inspectors said that a doctor told them that, one night in May, several residents were transferred to acute care hospitals all at once because he said, “we were over our heads.” The home was not able to care for residents or monitor them as needed. Woodbridge Vista was not even able to offer or serve residents hot or warm drinks, inspectors noted. William Osler Health System told inspectors that they offered support to the home on May 4 after hearing from one of its own staff members about the situation. The hospital said that Woodbridge Vista “did not reach out to their community partners for support.” The hospital temporarily took over management of the home on June 4. In the end, 31 people died at Woodbridge Vista due to COVID-19 alone. More recent government inspection reports show that some of the issues persist at the Sienna home, including incidents of neglect, inconsistent COVID-19 screening practices, failure to provide residents with safe food and fluid and failure to carry out infection prevention and control programs. Several of these issues happened as early as June 2021, including incidents where the home got extremely hot in the summer, but residents could not access a designated cooling area. Inspectors found the home had not implemented a heat-related illness prevention and management plan. “It frustrates me because nothing has changed even after all this time. There's still a staffing shortage, there’s still so many issues,” Puopolo said, adding that he’s currently in the process of getting another private personal support worker for his mother, who still lives at Woodbridge Vista, as she waits for a spot elsewhere. MORE BEDS FOR SIENNA DESPITE 471 PEOPLE DEAD As part of its most recent budget and campaign promise, the Progressive Conservative government has promised to add 30,000 new long-term care beds over the next 10 years, adding that 20,161 new and 15,918 upgraded beds are in the “development pipeline.” After Sienna Senior Living applied for some of those beds, the government allocated the company 223 new and 577 redeveloped beds. Sienna can use its allocations towards long-term care home projects, which will undergo a consultation process before being finalized. The province has so far granted Sienna 30-year licenses for two homes in North Bay and Brantford, Ont. The Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care told CTV News Toronto that the pandemic has displayed the urgent need to update homes to prevent the spread of outbreaks and will add capacity to areas of the province with “significant demand.” “The ministry’s evaluation process prioritized redevelopment of older homes to implement the lessons learned on improved infection prevention and control measures, particularly the elimination of three and four bed ward rooms, in which isolation and cohorting has proven difficult,” a spokesperson said. “New spaces built to modern design standards will help prevent and contain the transmission of infectious diseases and ensure residents have access to the care they need in a safe and secure environment.” The province’s latest round of applications for long-term care bed allocations closes on Nov. 2, 2021. The applications are open to all for-profit, not-for-profit and municipal operators. In a news conference on Tuesday regarding the Ontario government's plans to spend $20 million to double the number of long-term care home inspectors in the province, Long-Term Care Minister Rod Phillips did not provide an answer when asked why the long-term care homes listed in the military report have not received penalties. Advocates, families and experts are calling on the government to stop giving more public funds to for-profit companies with a history of violating the Long-Term Care Homes Act, and instead offer those ""rewards"" to the homes and companies that were praised for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had no deaths. According to government data, across the province, at least 471 people died in the 37 homes owned by Sienna Senior Living during the COVID-19 pandemic. While residents at Sienna's homes faced horrifying conditions and neglect as noted in military and inspection reports, the company paid $15.69 million to shareholders from April to June during the first wave. The home continues to pay millions to shareholders, while at the same time taking taxpayers dollars to build more beds. “They abused people and now they are going to get more beds,” Puopolo said. “I don't think the government should be giving any for-profit long-term care corporation a license for any more beds. If the military or a hospital was brought to run or help at one of their facilities, it tells me they don't have the skills to run a facility.” Puopolo said his mother had to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 and her health has declined significantly since the pandemic. “She’s not the same person,” he said. “She’s in worse physical shape, because she wasn’t getting proper care for three months so she deteriorated quite quickly. She’s not the same person I saw in January 2020. These people are older, they are elderly, and so when they suffer they don’t come back.” “Everyone in that facility is not the same as who they were before COVID.” A spokesperson for Sienna Senior Living told CTV News Toronto that it is focused on modernizing their older care communities and that the government support is vital for that. “The ongoing support provided to all long-term care homes by the provincial government is critical to the sector,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Adding additional beds, where possible, to our new care communities will help improve access for the thousands of seniors who are currently waiting for long-term care.” The spokesperson continued to say that the long-term care homes assisted by the military were “hit badly at the beginning of the first wave of COVID-19, before masks, social distancing, and many of the impactful measures became standard practice.” At Altamont Care Community, one of the homes at the centre of the Canadian Armed Forces first report on long-term care, 53 people died due to COVID-19 alone, but it is not yet clear how many people died due to other reasons such as neglect or hunger. CTV News Toronto asked Sienna Senior Living about the issue, but did not receive a response to this inquiry. The military report about the home, written by Brigadier-General C.J.J. Mialkowski, found that most residents at Altamont were not fed three meals a day due to staffing shortages and that “poor nutritional status was reported” due to the underfeeding. The military said that when they arrived at Altamont, they found many residents had been bed bound for several weeks and many residents had pressure ulcers due to the prolonged bed rest. They wrote that they saw no evidence that residents were being moved to wheelchairs for parts of the day, repositioned in bed or washed properly. “Significant number of residents have pressure ulcers, stage two, three and four and unstageable as a result of prolonged bed rest,” Mialkowski wrote. “Wound dressing orders have not been updated nor adhered to by agency staff causing further degradation of wound.” The Ford government initially refused to call in the armed forces in early April, saying they felt military aid wasn’t yet necessary despite the reports of severe staff shortages. If the government had sent in the military sooner, critics say more lives could have been saved. The details in the military report gave the public a first official glance in May 2020 at what was happening inside Altamont. In the military report, Mialkowski wrote that scheduling and staffing was a significant concern at the long-term care home. He said he noticed that, many times, no personal support workers were present after 2:30 p.m., and that, often, one of these workers were caring for 30 to 40 patients at a time, allowing them to only complete the most basic daily requirements, but no ability to provide “nail care, skin care, repositioning or adequate wound care.” In addition, they said that residents who got hungry around 3 a.m. would be told to have a cookie, some cold coffee or wait until morning because the kitchen was closed to workers at night. The military said they would give their own personal food to ensure residents didn’t go hungry. A resident inside the home during the pandemic told CTV News Toronto he could hear wailing inside the rooms at night for long periods as people called for help. ‘THE MOST HORRIFYING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN’ Ontario’s long-term care sector underwent significant change in 1998, when former Conservative Premier Mike Harris announced his government was awarding 20,000 new licences for long-term care beds. While not-for-profit churches and charities had dominated the industry before then, the majority of the new licenses were given to for-profit companies. Now, 58 per cent of long-term care homes belong to for-profit companies in Ontario, a number unseen anywhere else in Canada. According to data collected by the Ontario Health Coalition, the COVID-19 death rate during the pandemic involving for-profit long-term care homes in the province is about nine per cent; comparatively, in not-for-profit homes it stood at 5.25 per cent and, in publicly-owned homes, the number dropped to 3.62 per cent. Natalie Mehra, the executive director of the Ontario Health Coalition, said that, at the very least, the Ford government should not provide public funds to the companies with the worst records and violations, including those visited by the military. “Why would we be paying for-profit companies especially those with hideous records to be building the next generation of long-term care homes? It’s absurd,” she said. “More than 4,000 people are dead and that's not in keeping with the rest of the world, like no one else saw death rates like we saw in Canada in long-term care homes.” In order to build and redevelop beds, long-term care operators are currently paid a development grant and a construction subsidy, which is a per day payment for the 30 years of the license term. The construction subsidy is based on a project’s location and size. It can range anywhere between $20.51 to $23.78 per day, plus $1.50 per bed for homes with 96 beds or fewer and $0.75 per bed for homes with 96 to 160 beds. Long-term care corporations also get a capital development grant, which can range anywhere between $29,246 and $51,376 per bed depending also on where it is located and size. Larger homes in urban centres get the most money. Mehra told CTV News Toronto that a 200-bed home built in a large urban centre could provide a corporation with $10.26 million through the capital development grant and $52.1 million through the construction funding subsidy. At the same time, a company can also charge residents anywhere between $1,891.31 and $2,701.61 per month for accommodation at a long-term care home. “I don't know how, in any way shape or form, you can justify, providing more money and more licenses to homes that were occupied by the military, that had some of the most disastrous outcomes,” Dr. Vivian Stamatopoulos, a long-term care advocate, told CTV News Toronto. “I mean, we have the documents and evidence of which home, which chains of homes were the worst offenders. They got away with murder and they are just helping these very profitable companies become very wealthy.” “You’re rewarding those very bad actors for with another generation of licenses. It is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.” FORGOTTEN: Part three will be released tomorrow on CTVNewsToronto.ca"

The driver hits the horn — an aggressive, deafening bark — at the car he is now two inches away from. A big man has arrived and the message is simple: make way. The knot of traffic swirling around the digital billboard in the centre of the roundabout begins to loosen. The big man — or woman, or their child and nanny — is seated in the vehicle behind the Hilux: a black Mercedes G-Wagen SUV with tinted windows, which is trailed by another truck in a quasi-military shade of brownish-green. Inside are police officers, on secondment to a private security company. One leans out, AK-47 in hand, and slaps the bonnet of the car alongside. The message is clearer because he shouts it: “Move. Now.” More laconic looking police officers can be found outside every fancy apartment building in Lagos. They typically hold assault rifles by their trucks, which are usually parked next to the armoured Mercedes, Range Rovers or Toyota Land Cruisers their bosses drive. When the big man comes out, the officers mount up, sirens blaring, and cut through the Lagos traffic like a knife, pounding on the bonnets of cars as they pass. As the security situation worsens across Nigeria, escort and guard services for wealthy clients in Lagos are booming. By one count, about 40 per cent of the country’s police officers are working for private services. “Nigeria is going through this serious insecurity now,” says Ademola Onalaja, managing director of Proton Security Services, one of the country’s biggest private security companies. It employs some 9,000 guards, not counting police officers on secondment. “And so the protection of VIPs and national assets is paramount to the survival and economic growth of the country.” Ademola Onalaja of Proton Security Services © Grace Ekpu, for the FT The coronavirus pandemic hit Nigeria’s private security industry hard. Companies that require guards shut down, moved to remote work or scaled back operations; lucrative contracts to protect expatriates were cancelled as multinationals withdrew staff; the pandemic-induced oil price crash caused a brief recession amid generally sluggish growth; and many businesses — which are also potential clients — became cautious about spending money. The pandemic also came amid a general deterioration in security, with violence spreading to nearly every corner of the country, from the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east to a resurgent separatist movement in the south-east. An epidemic of kidnapping (the term many Nigerians use is “banditry”) that began in the north-west is now widespread in Nigeria, rendering many of its roads and highways all but impassable. But “our business has grown”, says Onalaja, a retired army colonel. The north-west and north-east, both hotspots of insecurity, have driven some of that growth, while the spread of the kidnapping threat toward the south-west — where Lagos is situated — means “you are finding VIPs also seeking more protection services . . . now they want to be 24/7 covered”, says Onalaja. Because private guards are not permitted to carry guns in Nigeria, the companies — including the local subsidiaries of foreign-owned groups — strike agreements with the national police, which provides armed officers to ride in trucks provided by the companies, under the supervision of a private security commander. Many of the officers guarding wealthy people are from the Mobile Police (known as Mopol), a paramilitary unit — originally riot squads — of the Nigerian Police Force. Police escorts are procured in one of two ways: via a private security company or, much more cheaply, directly at the local police station, which is the route that more and more middle-class Nigerians are taking for interstate trips as security threats have grown. “Anyone can get access to these now — it’s not just politicians or VIPs — because of the high rate of insecurity . . . because you don’t want to run into armed bandits or kidnappers on the way,” says Kemi Okenyodo, executive director of the Rule of Law Empowerment Initiative, a non-governmental organisation involved in security governance. On guard: a Mopol escort for a VIP in the upmarket Lagos suburb of Ikoyi © Fawaz Oyedeji, for the FT The officers are paid a stipend — usually between N5,000 and N7,000 ($12-$17) a day, depending on rank — and the local command receives an administration fee. But these fees are largely paid in cash, says Okenyodo, a security and policing expert. “So this income that is being generated, how much does it come to at the end of the day?” she adds. “What is it used for? Because we still continue to complain that the police are not performing.” The outsourcing of police for use by private companies took off at the height of the security crisis in the oil-rich Niger Delta in the second half of the 2000s, says Okenyodo. But where it was once ad hoc, it has now been institutionalised, with a VIP unit built into the police command structure. By one count, about 40 per cent of Nigeria’s police officers also work in private security In 2018, the then-chairman of the Police Service Commission, a civilian oversight body, said 150,000 of the country’s roughly 370,000 police officers were attached to VIPs, including wealthy people and former senior government officials. “We cannot afford to have [so much] of the population of the police in private hands,” Mike Okiro, who also served as inspector-general of police (IGP) between 2007 and 2009, told the state-run News Association of Nigeria at the time. There is little indication that anything has changed. Successive IGPs have called for the withdrawal of police officers attached to the rich and powerful — including the latest incumbent, who in one of his first acts after his appointment in April issued such a directive, less than a year after his predecessor had done the same. The Nigerian Police Force did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Wale Olaoye, chief executive of Halogen, which with 25,000 employees is the country’s biggest private security company, says he understands the criticism that scarce police resources are being diverted. “In the future, the ideal situation is to license certain [qualified] companies to bear arms, so that we can create an executive protection unit out of private companies and release the [police] back to do what they do,” he says. Both Olaoye and Onalaja say they hope the government will consider changing the rules. But Daniel Lemmer, director of commercial operations at Pilgrims Africa, part of a UK security group that has a subsidiary in Nigeria with about 2,500 employees, does not think that will happen. “[For] African leaders, if you do start arming them [private security staff], what stops them from overthrowing the country? There’s that fear,” he says. If wealthy people’s first impression is, “I’m not getting protected”, they may not come back to invest “The other part is: how do you actually control all of those weapons? It will require a whole sort of mindset change. The army and the police lose enough weapons — I don’t think they can afford more weapons to be out in the open, out in the streets.” Lemmer says he understands why people criticise the use of police for guarding wealthy Nigerians and foreigners. But he argues that they serve an essential economic purpose. “The police are definitely needed to escort the high-wealth individuals and the expatriates, because they need to feel secure coming into the country, coming to invest,” he says. “If they are left to their own devices and their first impression is, ‘I’m not getting protected, I feel vulnerable’, they may not come back. “Can you imagine if your high-value clients and your visitors and investors do get kidnapped?” he adds. “If there was a spree of kidnapping, no one would return to Nigeria, so these guys are doing a great service for Nigeria.” This article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment"

""We are deeply concerned about the Israeli government's plan to advance thousands of settlement units tomorrow, Wednesday, many of them deep in the West Bank,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told a briefing. ""We strongly oppose the expansion of settlements, which is completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm, and it damages the prospects for a two-state solution,"" Price said. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel on Sunday published tenders for about 1,300 new settlement homes in the occupied West Bank and authorities are also expected to discuss proposals for another 3,000 homes. read more Washington was continuing to raise its views on the issue directly with senior Israeli officials, Price said. U.S.-backed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. Most countries regard Israel's West Bank settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this. Israeli settlement activity is a source of disagreement between Israel and Washington, together with U.S. efforts to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran, Israel's arch foe. Since President Joe Biden took office in January, U.S. officials have emphasized that they oppose further expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied land the Palestinians want for a future state. A senior Biden administration official said earlier this month that Israel was aware of the administration's view of the need to refrain from actions that could be seen as ""provocative"" and undermine efforts to achieve a long-elusive two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had until Sunday mostly held off announcing new settlement construction since taking office in June, as he sought to ease tensions with Washington.

Two men went on trial on Tuesday over the 2018 murder of an elderly Jewish woman that provoked protests and alarm in France about anti-Semitic crime. Advertising Read more The partly burned body of Mireille Knoll, 85, was found in her apartment in central Paris after she had been stabbed 11 times before her home was set on fire. President Emmanuel Macron attended the funeral of the Holocaust survivor who escaped a notorious 1942 roundup of more than 13,000 Jews in Paris by fleeing with her mother to Portugal when she was nine years old. Two men have been charged with her killing, a 25-year-old homeless man with psychiatric problems and the 31-year-old son of one of Kroll's neighbours. Mrs Knoll's son expects 'tough verdict' 00:59 The pair, who met in prison and have past convictions for theft and violence, both deny killing the frail and immobile grandmother and each blames the other for her death. ""We will need a miracle for the truth to come out of their mouths,"" Gilles-William Goldnadel, a lawyer acting for Knoll's family, told reporters as he entered the court, adding that it was a case of ""anti-Semitism motivated by financial gain."" >> 'Enough is enough', say marchers at Paris rally for murdered Holocaust survivor Prosecutors are treating the murder as an anti-Semitic hate crime because one of the men said he had overheard the other ""talking about Jews' money and their wealth"" and that he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") while stabbing her. The investigation had also shown one of the suspects, named as Yacine Mihoub, had an ""ambivalent"" attitude towards Islamic extremism, prosecutors claim. ""They're monsters,"" Knoll's son, Daniel Knoll, told reporters on Tuesday. ""We are expecting a very severe verdict."" Both Mihoub, 31, and co-accused Alex Carrimbacus, 25, were present in court or the trial which is due to last until November 10. 'Murdered because Jewish' The murder was the latest in a series of attacks that have horrified France's 500,000-strong Jewish community and exacerbated concern about how rising Islamic extremism is fuelling anti-Semitism. An estimated 30,000 people took part in a silent march in her memory in March 2018 that was attended by government ministers and the heads of France's political parties. One of the organisers, Sabrina Moise, said at that the time that while she ""loves France"" she felt it was ""no longer safe for Jews because of galloping anti-Semitism."" In 2012, Islamist gunman Mohamed Merah shot dead three children and a teacher at a Jewish school in the southwestern city of Toulouse. Three years later, a gunman killed four people in a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket in the French capital. And in 2017, an Orthodox Jewish woman in her sixties, Sarah Halimi, was thrown out of the window of her Paris flat by a neighbour shouting ""Allahu Akhbar"". France's highest court ruled in April that the killer, Kobili Traore, was not criminally responsible for crime after succumbing to a ""delirious fit"" under the influence of drugs and could not go on trial. That ruling infuriated the victim's family as well as Jewish groups, and prompted Macron to urge a change in French law to ensure people face responsibility for violent crimes while under the influence of drugs. It also prompted protests in France and also Israel. Speaking about Knoll, Macron had said her killer ""murdered an innocent and vulnerable woman because she was Jewish and in doing so had sullied our most sacred values and our memory.""

Corien Wortmann-Kool, the chair of ABP, the Dutch pension fund for civil servants and teachers, said it would no longer invest in producers of oil, gas and coal, and that it would dispense with its current investments in those sectors by the first quarter of 2023. The fund said it did not expect the decision to have a negative impact on long-term returns for its pension customers. It will invest instead in electricity companies, the car industry and aviation but Wortmann-Kool claimed the fund would be in a better position to push those companies towards being “more sustainable”. He said: “We want to contribute to minimising global warming to 1.5C. Large groups of pension participants and employers indicate how important this is to them. “The ABP board sees the need and urgency for a change of course. We part with our investments in fossil fuel producers because we see insufficient opportunity for us as a shareholder to push for the necessary, significant acceleration of the energy transition at these companies.” At Shell’s AGM in May, ABP voted in favour of the company’s own climate strategy, under which its emissions would increase over the next decade. Mark van Baal from Follow This, a campaign group that uses activist investment to pressure oil companies into decarbonising in line with the limits set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: “Today, Shell loses one of their best friends. We hope this is a wake-up call for the board of Shell. “We hope more critical investors will replace ABP as shareholders in Big Oil. This is a victory for the fossil-free movement and a victory for the fight against the climate crisis. It shows how a group of citizens can make an impact.” ABF has holdings in about 80 companies in the fossil fuel sector, accounting for almost 3% of its €528bn total assets. In September, the climate action group Fossil Free launched a lawsuit against the fund seeking a ruling on whether ABP needed to divest from fossil fuels in order to align its investment policy with its promise to adhere to the Paris climate agreement. That followed a ruling in May from a court in The Hague, which ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in a landmark case brought by Friends of the Earth. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. McKenzie Ursch, a legal adviser for Follow This, said he believed the court rulings could have been a significant factor in ABF’s decision. He said: “This foreshadows a new wave of litigation against major GHG [greenhouse gas] emitters, and indicates that oil majors and large investors have an individual responsibility to combat climate change.”"

Police around the world have arrested 150 suspects involved in buying or selling illegal goods online in one of the largest-ever stings on the dark web, according to Europol. Operation DarkHunTOR also recovered millions of euros in cash and Bitcoin, as well as drugs and guns, the European Union’s police agency said on Tuesday. The bust stems from a German-led police sting earlier this year taking down the “world’s largest” dark web marketplace, which had been used by its alleged operator, an Australian, to facilitate the sale of drugs, stolen credit card data and malware. Dark HunTOR, “was composed of a series of separate but complementary actions in Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States,” the Hague-based Europol said.

The dark web is a hidden collective of internet sites only accessible by specialised web browsing software. It keeps online activity anonymous and private, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track criminal behaviour. But it can also be used to protect whistleblowers and help others evade government censorship."

Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy United Nations Chief António Guterres said in a speech that countries are ""utterly failing"" to fight the climate crisis, according to a UN report released Monday that found countries' pledges to reduce carbon emissions are falling significantly short of targets. ""The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,"" Guterres told reporters on Tuesday. ""But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe."" The Paris agreement set a goal to keep global warming from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, but the UN report found countries are falling behind. Unless action is taken quickly, temperatures could rise to about 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. In addition, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) — a UN body — said on Monday that carbon dioxide has risen by more than the 10-year average in 2020 to 413.2 part per million, despite the world economy slowing during the pandemic. ""We are way off track,"" WMO's Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said, adding that carbon dioxide levels haven't been this high for at least 3 million years. All of this information comes a week before dozens of world leaders meet in Glasgow for the UN's climate summit. This will be the first time the US is participating in the summit since rejoining the Paris agreement — President Donald Trump had withdrawn the country from the pledge during his term — and President Joe Biden previously expressed concerns with the how the US is addressing the climate ahead of the summit. ""The prestige of the United States is on the line,"" Biden told a group of progressive lawmakers last week, according to California Rep. Ro Khanna. ""I need this to go represent the United States overseas. I need people to see that the Democratic Party is working, that the country is working, that we can govern."" Biden's concern stems from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's opposition to his economic and climate agenda as the two centrist holdouts. Biden's campaign proposal of the Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP), which would cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, was cut from Democrats' reconciliation bill due to Manchin's opposition. Now, Democrats are working to develop a framework that would meet the needs of the climate without CEPP, but as Guterres said, time is running out to address global warming before it becomes an ""existential threat to humanity."" And especially following a UN report in August saying some of global warming's effects will be ""irreversible for centuries to millennia,"" pressure is ramping up on Biden and other countries in meeting the urgency of climate change."

Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – Police in Indian-administered Kashmir have filed criminal cases under a stringent anti-terror law against the students of two medical colleges in the region for celebrating Pakistan’s victory against India in the T20 World Cup. Pakistan thrashed archrival India with a 10-wicket victory in the cricket match held in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday night. India’s loss triggered attacks against Kashmiri students in western Punjab state and a Muslim member of the Indian team was abused online. Anti-India sentiment runs deep in Kashmir, a Himalayan territory claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan who rule over parts of it. A popular rebellion against the Indian rule erupted in Indian-administered Kashmir the 1990s, with the rebels demanding either a merger with Muslim-majority Pakistan or an independent state. In such a scenario, an India-Pakistan cricket match evokes strong reactions mainly in the valley, with residents publicly declaring their support for Pakistan to make a political statement. India-Pakistan cricket matches provoke strong reactions in South Asia. This photo shows Mohammed Shami, (left), who faced online abuse after India lost the T20 match [Aijaz Rahi/AP] Following Sunday’s match, there were similar celebrations in the disputed region over Pakistan’s first-ever win against India in a cricket World Cup. Among those cheering were students from the region’s top medical colleges: the Government Medical College and the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, both situated in the main city of Srinagar. Videos of their celebration outside their residential hostels went viral on social media. On Tuesday, a senior police official told Al Jazeera that two cases under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) have been filed against an unknown number of students for causing “insult to the national sentiment during the cricket match”. No student has been named in the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the police and no arrests have been made so far. But the move has triggered outrage in the region since it comes a day after more than a dozen Kashmiri students were assaulted by a mob in at least two colleges in Punjab for celebrating Pakistan’s victory against India. The students alleged they were watching the match in their rooms when people carrying sticks attacked them, seriously wounding some. The UAPA cases against the medical students were filed following a barrage of online trolling, with some social media users saying the students should be “sent to Pakistan” and denied government jobs in future. Indian paramilitary soldiers frisk Kashmiris during a surprise check operation in Srinagar [Dar Yasin/AP] During the 2014 Asia Cup tournament, nearly 60 Kashmiri students were suspended by a college in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh after they celebrated Pakistan’s win over India. The charges were later dropped. Ravinder Raina, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) in Indian-administered Kashmir, said all those who cheered for “enemy country” Pakistan will be in jail soon. “Those people who celebrated Pakistanis’ win in Kashmir or any other place, the case has been registered. These people will be identified and they will be behind bars soon,” Raina, who is based in the southern city of Jammu, told reporters. Mehbooba Mufti, the former chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, criticised the attacks on Kashmiris following their reaction to Pakistan’s victory. “Why such anger against Kashmiris for celebrating Pakistan’s win?” she asked on Twitter. “One hasn’t forgotten how many celebrated by distributing sweets when [region] was dismembered and stripped of special status,” she wrote, referring to India’s 2019 move. In August 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government scrapped Articles 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution, effectively stripping India’s only Muslim-majority region of its limited autonomy. The move was followed by a months-long security clampdown, the arrests of hundreds of Kashmiris, and the splitting of the region into two federally controlled territories. Since then, the heavily militarised region has witnessed unprecedented unrest, with at least 39 people, including 12 civilians, 17 rebels and 10 Indian soldiers, killed this month alone. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the region since 1990 due to the conflict. A Kashmiri human rights lawyer, who did not want to be named, told Al Jazeera that shouting “Pakistan zindabad” (Long live Pakistan) after a cricket win is not legally wrong. “The court will ultimately throw out the case against these students, but under UAPA, it is virtually impossible to secure bail,” he told Al Jazeera. “It is very immature, insensitive and harsh to impose a stringent anti-terror law on students for a mere celebration, howsoever enthusiastic they may have been.”"

Governments will be in the spotlight at the COP26 conference next week to meet a deadline of this year to commit to more ambitious cut pledges, in what could be the last chance to put the world on track to limiting warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and ideally to 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). As extreme weather events from wildfires to floods have hit countries around the world, a U.N. report in August warned that global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions could breach 1.5C in the next two decades. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was ""touch and go"" whether the most important round of U.N. talks since the Paris Agreement in 2015 will secure the agreements needed to tackle climate change. read more And the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said ahead of the two-week event that begins in Glasgow, Scotland on Sunday that greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record last year and the world is ""way off track"" in capping rising temperatures. The annual ""emissions gap"" report by the United Nations' Environment Programme (UNEP), which measures the gap between anticipated emissions and those consistent with limiting the temperature rise this century as agreed in the Paris accord, said updated pledges only reduce forecast 2030 emissions by an additional 7.5%, compared to the previous commitments. If continued throughout this century, this would lead to warming of 2.7C, slightly less than the 3C UNEP forecast in its last report. A 30% cut is needed to limit warming to 2C and a 55% cut is needed to limit to 1.5C. It said current commitments to net zero could limit warming to around 2.2C by the end of the century, but 2030 pledges so far do not put major emitters on a clear path to this. As a group, G20 countries, which represent 80% of global emissions, are not on track to achieve their original or new 2030 pledges. ""If there is no meaningful reduction of emissions in the next decade, we will have lost forever the possibility to reach 1.5 degrees,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told a press briefing. ""It is absolutely essential that all G20 countries present before Glasgow or in Glasgow (pledges) that are compatible with 1.5C,"" he added. 1/3 Icebergs are seen at the mouth of the Jakobshavn ice fjord near Ilulissat, Greenland, September 16, 2021. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke Read More THE CLOCK IS TICKING Latest U.N. data shows 143 countries, accounting for around 57% of global emissions, have submitted new or updated emissions cut plans ahead of COP26 and their total emissions are estimated to be around 9% of 2010 levels by 2030 if implemented fully. But if all pledges by 192 countries under the Paris Agreement are taken together, an increase of around 16% in global emissions is expected by 2030 compared to 2010, which would lead to warming of around 2.7C. China and India, which are together responsible for around 30% of global emissions, have not yet made enhanced pledges. Over the last 11 years, policies have been put in place which will lower annual emissions by 11 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent by 2030, compared to what would have happened without these policies, the report said. However, fossil fuel production is not slowing at the rate needed, with major economies set to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than is consistent with meeting climate goals. read more ""On current progress, we’ll close the 2030 emissions gap sometime in the 2080s,"" Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the report, said. By 2030, to reach the 1.5C limit, annual greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by an extra 28 Gt, or be halved from current levels of nearly 60 Gt, over and above what is promised in updated pledges and other 2030 commitments, UNEP said. For the 2C limit, an additional 13 Gt cut in annual emissions is needed by 2030. ""We have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,"" UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said. ""The clock is ticking loudly.""

Advertisement For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app. However, neither group has the capability to do so yet. “We could see ISIS-K generate that capability in somewhere between six or 12 months … and al-Qaeda [within] a year or two,” Kahl said told the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Asked about the Taliban’s ability or willingness to fight ISIS and other terrorist groups, Kahl said Washington had not yet made a determination. Previously, US generals and State Department officials said they would judge the Taliban - which took over Afghanistan within days of the US withdrawal - based on their actions. Kahl also told lawmakers that the Pentagon’s work related to Afghanistan was far from over. “We are examining and learning from the past, reckoning with the uncomfortable truth that despite decades and billions of dollars of US investment, the Afghan military evaporated in the face of the Taliban assault.” And as other Biden administration officials have done, Kahl vehemently defended the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. “We are turning to the future, bolstering our capacity to engage in over-the-horizon counterterrorism operations to ensure that no threat emanating from Afghanistan can harm our homeland or our interests, even as we re-focus the Department on the challenges posed by China, Russia, and other competitors and adversaries,” Kahl said. For his part, Lt. Gen. James Mingus also defended the withdrawal and evacuation efforts made by US troops and officials. Mingus, too warned about potential terrorist attacks on the US. “While we reprioritize following the withdrawal in the short-term, we are actively setting the conditions to ensure we remain situationally aware and are postured to mitigate and neutralize developing terrorist threat streams,” he said.

China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization (WHO), compared with only five last year, it said. Though the numbers are much lower than the hundreds infected with H7N9 in 2017, the infections are serious, leaving many critically ill, and at least six dead. ""The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality,"" said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on Oct. 4. It said further investigation was ""urgently"" required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people. Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on Oct. 13, according to a Hong Kong government statement. While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020. China is the world's biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month said the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health"". Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighbouring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces. At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant. ""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)...or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected,"" said Kuiken. Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September report by China's CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms. China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. Backyard farms in China are common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens at markets. Guilin city in Guangxi region, which had two human cases in August, said last month it had suspended trading of live poultry in 13 urban markets and would abolish the trade within a year.

There are the scars the length of his inner left forearm that he slashed up with a razor blade when he was 16. That was in D Block in Paremoremo prison, the harshest wing in New Zealand’s maximum security prison. “There’s about nine or 10 cuts. I missed the tendons. I ended up with 177 stitches. When I came to they were plaster-casting it. I’d passed out. They took me back to the cell, ‘clean your shit up Wickliffe, here’s a bucket and mop. You’re on charges,’” Wickliffe recalls. Wickliffe recently gave evidence on the notorious psychiatric hospital Lake Alice at the royal commission into abuse in care. At the conclusion, chairperson Coral Shaw choked up with emotion as she thanked him. Between 1972 and 1978 it is estimated that about 300 children went through the unit. Wickliffe’s scars are overlaid with a “glove” of ink that covers the entire forearm and most of his hand, a status symbol of his time in D Block. His right arm lists D Block and also Mt Eden, the Victorian era prison in Auckland where Wickliffe landed as a 14-year-old after going on a road trip in a stolen car with mates who’d escaped a welfare home. One of his fingers has “Kohitere” tattooed on the inside, a boys welfare home, while another is inked with “Waikeria”, a youth borstal. Rangi Wickliffe’s ‘Fuck justice’ tattoo, which he added to his leg with boot polish. Photograph: Aaron Smale/The Guardian Then there’s the one on the back of his neck. It has the outline of watchtowers and a noose. It’s a memorial to the 11 guys who killed themselves while he was in D Block. But the one that goes beyond the documentary record, verging on the philosophical, is on the side of his shin. It simply says, “Fuck Justice.” Wickliffe was in his early 20s when he etched that one. He’d figured out the word justice was loaded with hypocrisy. He was punished for his crimes, mostly burglaries. But no one has ever been convicted for the crimes committed against him when he was a child, including rape. “I was in my 20s. I tried to tell them my history about abuse, but they weren’t interested. Screws, judges, lawyers, no one gave a shit.” ‘They created monsters like me’ When he was four his grandmother found he’d been physically abused by an extended family member. She took him into her care but struggled to manage him and asked Social Welfare for help. Instead of help, he was made a ward of the state and over the next 10 years in the state’s custody he was repeatedly sexually, physically and psychologically abused. He would repeatedly run away, only to be sent to a worse institution. His criminal record started at the age of six when he broke into a house and stole an apple and some loose change. “I was jumping through windows for survival and to get away from the abuse.” At the age of 10 he was admitted to the adolescent unit at Lake Alice, an institution for criminally insane adults. Of all the institutions he went through, he regards Lake Alice as the most terrifying and damaging long-term. He describes how it was there that he underwent punishment through electric shocks and was repeatedly raped by criminally insane adult patients and one of the staff. On one occasion he says he was given electric shocks for not eating his vegetables. On another it was for getting bad marks in maths. He says he witnessed another boy getting electric shocks on his genitals. Like the welfare homes, the majority of the children at the hospital were Māori boys. The high numbers of Māori in the welfare system has parallels with the Stolen Generations in Australia and the residential schools in North America. The faces he saw in the welfare homes and Lake Alice were the same faces he’d see when he started going into adult prisons. Compared to what they’d been through in the welfare system, prison was familiar but also easier. We’re now on to the third or fourth generation. They’re extremely violent and that’s no surprise. Rangi Wickliffe “After being in solitary confinement in Lake Alice, how do you think I fitted in. I fitted in perfectly. They weren’t sodomising and electrocuting me. I’m used to solitary confinement.” New Zealand’s prisons are now filled with several generations of men who went through the same system that was meant to rescue them but taught them violence. “The ones coming through are worse. They created monsters like me. Then you’ve got the next generation. We’re now on to the third or fourth generation. They’re extremely violent and that’s no surprise. It justifies building more prisons, it also justifies arming the police, it also justifies shooting Māori as being the major offenders of those kinds of offences.” He says the criminal justice system, including judges and the psychiatrists that inform their decisions, only see the violent adult and not the damaged, traumatised child that was created by other state agencies. Rangi Wickliffe’s arm, which shows tattoos memorialising his time in Paremoremo prison’s D Block, the harshest wing of the maximum security prison, and Mt Eden, a Victorian era prison in Auckland. Photograph: Aaron Smale/The Guardian “I’ve had forensic psychologists, forensic psychiatrists say all sorts of things about me, none of them knowing about my past or that I’d been to Lake Alice. “Every psychological report that has been written on me points out my bad behaviour. But there’s nothing on there about what the state has done to me. And my family.” It wasn’t just reports from official sources but the stigma of Lake Alice that has hung over the lives of survivors. That stigma has closed doors to employment despite most of the children in the adolescent unit having no diagnosed mental illness. Civil litigation in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to a payout totalling around $13m, which amounted to around $100,000 for each victim. However, the first group of claimants had legal fees deducted which reduced it to around $50,000. Wickliffe has managed to stay out of prison for the past five years, one of his longest periods on the outside, which he puts down to the support of his partner, Dawn. She was the mother of his first child but they only reunited after his last prison sentence after decades apart. Despite leaving the criminal justice system behind, his views on it haven’t changed since he added the tattoo on his leg with boot polish. “Fuck justice. I’ve been fighting for justice for how long now. Everyone can say that [tattoo] came back and bit you in the arse. No, not at all. I knew that from the beginning.”"

Russia had sought to take control of the historical treasures, often called the “Scythian gold”, which includes gold and ceremonial daggers used by the nomadic tribe, a golden helmet from the 4th century BC, amulets, jewellery, and other treasures, including a Chinese lacquered box that made its way to Crimea along the Silk Road. Formally, the return of the exhibition is sought by four Crimean museums that lent the artefacts to the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam in 2014. Those museums came under Russian control after the annexation. The highly anticipated appeals court decision was received as another condemnation of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which has been rejected in the west and recognised by just a handful of governments around the world. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called the ruling a “long-awaited victory”. “We always return what is ours,” Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. “First we will return the ‘Scythian gold,’ and then we will return Crimea.” Earlier this year, Ukraine held a Crimean platform summit where officials from 46 countries and blocs, including the Netherlands, signed a joint declaration on the “non-recognition of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea”. Russia, which maintains de facto control over the region, has sought to integrate the peninsula through large infrastructure projects such as a bridge to mainland Russia. Vladimir Putin has also staked a cultural and historical claim to the peninsula, saying in a 2014 speech after the annexation that the region had “returned to its home harbour”. Locals who have protested the annexation have been charged with separatism and other crimes. Russian officials have condemned the Dutch court’s decision, although they stopped short of repeating threats to cut off all inter-museum exchanges with the Netherlands. A Crimean official said the decision “flagrantly violate the right of the Crimean people to access their own cultural heritage”. Mikhail Shvydkoi, a Russian official tasked as an envoy for international cultural cooperation, said that the museums would try to appeal against the decision up to the supreme court of the Netherlands. He called the case of the Scythian gold “a kind of force majeure”. The collection has been billed as one of the most important exhibitions on international loan in Ukraine’s history. “Never before has Ukraine made so many prize archaeological exhibits available on loan: stunning artefacts made of gold, including a scabbard and a ceremonial helmet, and countless precious gems,” the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam announced before the February 2014 opening of its exhibit “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea”. Less than one month later, Russian troops without insignia seized key infrastructure in Crimea, setting off a chain of events that led to the peninsula’s annexation by Russia."

Protesters under the umbrella of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) want the price capped at $1.50 for diesel and $2 for petrol. The Conaie movement is credited with helping topple three presidents between 1997 and 2005, and in 2019 led successful protests against the government's scrapping of fuel subsidies as required by the International Monetary Fund. It was too little and too late to assuage widespread discontent with economic policy in a country that exports oil but imports much of the fuel it consumes. Indigenous people represent 7.4 percent of the country's 17.7 million inhabitants.

The song’s music video — which has received over 12 million views in a span of a week — is supposed to mock China’s authoritarian government, Taiwan News The song’s title “Fragile,” which is translated to “glass heart” (玻璃心) on YouTube, refers to Chinese netizens who become keyboard warriors whenever someone criticizes the Chinese Communist Party on social media. The music video heavily features the color pink, which supposedly refers to online patriotic Chinese nationalists, also known as “little pinks.” According to Taiwan News, the satirical song made references to the “repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China’s claims to Taiwan, bat soup representing COVID, the Great Firewall, Xi Jinping embodied by Winnie the Pooh, censorship and the ban on Taiwan-grown fruits.” The lyrics also seemingly refer to China’s relationship with Taiwan and Beijing’s “sweeping claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea,” reported CNA English News ﻿ “Pardon me for offending”: Award-winning hip-hop artist Namewee said he was inspired by his online interactions to create “Fragile.” Advertisement He told CNA that it was “fascinating how some would obsess over small details and then amplify them endlessly.” Many netizens know of Namewee because he is not afraid to address political and social issues in his songs. “You’re a bad listener, but retaliate on each one there is.

Bolsonaro on Thursday night posted a video in which he said reports from the United Kingdom (U.K.) floated the possibility that “vaccinated people are developing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,” according to The Washington Post. U.K. health officials, however, rejected that claim, telling G1, a Brazilian news outlet, that the president’s statements were false, the Post reported. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS has also said that coronavirus vaccines authorized by health regulators are safe for individuals who have HIV, according to Reuters. ADVERTISEMENT Facebook issued a statement on Monday announcing that Bolsonaro's comments did not comply with the company’s policy banning claims that COVID-19 vaccines are fatal or seriously harmful. “Our policies don't allow claims that COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people,” the company said in a statement to The Hill. Bolsonaro has remained a coronavirus skeptic even as COVID-19 has ravaged Brazil. He opposed the vaccine and earlier this month said he was “bored” with questions about the country’s increasing COVID-19 death toll. He has also been repeatedly accused of spreading misinformation regarding COVID-19, with some Brazilian doctors arguing that he is downplaying the severity of the pandemic. Bolsonaro could also face 11 criminal charges after Brazil’s Senate conducted a probe of his response to the pandemic. Renan Calheiros, the senator who oversaw the investigation, said during a radio interview earlier this month that the probe will recommend charges such as genocide against Brazil’s Indigenous population, malfeasance, irregular use of public funds, violation of sanitary measures, incitement to crime and forgery of private documents, according to Reuters. Bolsonaro posted a video to his YouTube channel in July in which he advised taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to treat COVID-19, according to Reuters, but the video was ultimately taken down by Alphabet.

The Republican leaders in the Senate have often indulged false allegations of fraud from other members of their party. In a statement, WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe said the commission will be happy to provide clarity to the Senate investigators. “We don't know anything more than what was in the press release at this point,"" Wolfe said. “Once we learn what it's all about, we'll be happy to provide any clarity we can. Meanwhile, we remain proud of the great work done by nearly 2,000 clerks and thousands more poll workers across Wisconsin to carry out a safe, secure and accurate election during a national pandemic."" The audit found that there were minimal examples of voter fraud in 2020 and affirmed what lawsuits, court cases and recounts had already found — that Joe Biden won Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes. Thus far, the Republicans in the Assembly have taken the lead on probing into the 2020 election. Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman has been hired by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) to search for fraud. Gableman's review has been criticized as partisan, unprofessional and harmful to democracy. Now, the Senate is getting into the game with an investigation by the Senate Committee on Elections, Election Process Reform And Ethics. The elections committee investigation will look further into the findings of the audit and the City of Madison's decision not to provide documents and ballots to the auditors — a decision that has infuriated Republicans. “I was disappointed to see that an elected official tasked with the administration of fair and transparent elections would refuse their duty to provide requested information necessary to prove they did their job adequately,"" Senate President Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) said in a statement. “That is unacceptable."" The city clerk is not an elected position in Madison. But the audit report gives some reasoning for why the city did not provide documents. “The U.S. Department of Justice indicated that election officials are responsible for retaining and preserving election records, regardless of who physically possesses them,"" the report states. “In part as a result of this guidance from the Department of Justice, the City of Madison clerk did not allow us to physically handle election records."" That guidance, which was released by DOJ in July, states that election officials who turn over ballots could be held responsible for violating the Civil Rights Act. “But the Department is concerned that some jurisdictions conducting them may be using, or proposing to use, procedures that risk violating the Civil Rights Act,"" the guidance states. “The duty to retain and preserve election records necessarily requires that elections officials maintain the security and integrity of those records and their attendant chain of custody, so that a complete and uncompromised record of federal elections can be reliably accessed and used in federal law enforcement matters. Where election records leave the control of elections officials, the systems for maintaining the security, integrity and chain of custody of those records can easily be broken."" City of Madison Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl also said on Monday that the auditors were offered alternatives to physically taking the city's ballots, but did not accept that offer. “We offered the LAB the opportunity to schedule appointments to view but not touch documents, as we have offered everyone asking to see or handle election documents,"" Witzel-Behl told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel's Molly Beck. “They did not schedule any appointments in response to that offer."" While Gableman's partisan review continues amid legal pressure and criticism, the Senate elections committee is set to investigate the findings of the Legislative Audit Bureau's investigation. The elections committee is chaired by Sen. Kathleen Bernier (R-Chippewa Falls), a former Chippewa County clerk who ran election administration in her county for 12 years. Bernier has been one of the few Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature who has consistently dismissed allegations of fraud in last year's election.

In October, German prosecutors said they were ""100 per cent convinced"" Christian B, 44, was the man responsible for McCann's disappearance in 2007. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told the Mirror: ""It is now possible that we could charge. We have that evidence now. “But it’s not just about charging him – we want to charge him with the best body of evidence possible. “When we still have questions, it would be nonsense to charge rather than wait for the answers that could strengthen our position. “That’s why we said we’ll investigate as long as there are leads or information for us to pursue."" An inside source said: ""It will be a sort of trial run to see how strong their case is and see what more evidence might be needed to charge him. ""They are 100 per cent convinced but want to test arguments under cross-examination."" Madeleine, from Leicestershire, vanished aged three from parents Kate and Gerry’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Two years earlier, Christian B raped a 72-year-old American woman living nearby and is now in a German jail for the crime. As he is in prison, detectives are using the time to gather much evidence as possible and hope to take him to court next year. Part of the evidence being probed by cops includes an alleged ""confession"" made by Christian B to a friend, and analysis of the phone shows he was at the Ocean Club when the tot disappeared. But investigators have no proof Madeleine is dead, with no DNA or photo evidence linking the sex offender to the alleged murder. Wolters told the outlet: ""It is circumstantial evidence – we have no scientific evidence. ""I personally think a conclusion will be reached next year. We have no body and no DNA but we have other evidence. Based on the evidence we have, it leads to no other conclusion."" Christian B is also being investigated in connection with a rape and indecent assaults that all took place in Praia da Luz when he lived there from 2002 to 2008. He denies any involvement in Maddie's disappearance and claims police have not found a ""shred of evidence"". Christian B was living on the outskirts of Praia da Luz when Maddie disappeared and became a suspect in 2017 but not named publicly as one until June 2020. 3 Maddie's parents Kate and Gerry McCann Credit: Alamy"

Poland is involved in a bitter confrontation with the European Union over a series of controversial judicial reforms.

In an FT interview, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged the EU to reverse its decision to ask the European Court of Justice to fine Poland over the reforms. ""This would be the wisest thing they can do. Because then we are not talking to each other with a gun to our head.""

If they start the third world war, we are going to defend our rights with any weapons which are at our disposal."" Poland's Constitutional Court earlier this month ruled that parts of EU law were incompatible with the Polish constitution. The ruling raised concerns that Poland could leave the bloc. The dispute soured a summit of EU leaders in Brussels last week at which Mr Morawiecki said Poland was ""ready for dialogue"" but would not ""act under the pressure of blackmail"". Several EU leaders at the summit said Brussels should not release €36 billion in pandemic recovery money that Poland badly wants while the issue is unresolved. The dispute has focused on a new disciplinary chamber for judges that the European Court of Justice has found to be illegal. Poland has promised to close it down but has not yet done so."

Sophie Fornairon's independent bookshop has survived the rise of Amazon thanks to a French law that prohibits price discounting on new books, but she says the e-commerce giant's ability to undercut on shipping still skews the market against stores like hers. Advertising Read more Fornairon, who owns the Canal Bookstore in central Paris, now hopes that new legislation that would set a minimum price for book deliveries will even the contest further in the battle of neighbourhood stores against Amazon. ""It's a just return towards a level playing field,"" Fornairon, who employs four workers, said. ""We're not at risk of closing down any time soon, but Amazon is a constant battle"". Amazon said the legislation, adopted by parliament but not yet enacted, would punish those in rural areas who cannot easily visit a bookstore and rely on delivery. ""Imposing a minimum shipping cost for books would weigh on the purchasing power of consumers,"" Amazon told Reuters in a statement. That is an undesirable consequence government officials are wary of at a time President Emmanuel Macron administration is scrambling to head off growing discontent over rising energy prices six months from an election. In the country of Victor Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir, where local bookshops are held with special affection -- they were deemed 'essential businesses' during latter COVID lockdowns -- the move is the latest by the state to shield national culture against big tech firms. More than 20% of the 435 million books sold in France in 2019 were bought online and the market share of France's 3,300 independent bookstores has been slowly declining because of competition from online retailers like Amazon, Fnac and Leclerc. Support from Macron helped push the legislation, which does not target Amazon by name, over the line. The minimum fee still has to be negotiated with the regulator. 'Distorted competition' French law prohibits free book deliveries but Amazon has circumvented this by charging a single centime (cent). Local book stores typically charge about 5-7 euros ($5.82-8.15) for shipping a book. Amazon's pricing strategy had resulted in the growing market share of a single operator, the Ministry of Culture said. ""This law is necessary to regulate the distorted competition within online book sales and prevent the inevitable monopoly that will emerge if the status quo persists,"" the ministry told Reuters. >>>French book prize kicks up storm with Amazon selection Centre-right Senator Laure Darcos, who drafted the law, decided upon the minimum delivery charge when she observed how bookstores maintained 70% of their business despite being forced to shut during early COVID lockdowns, because the government reimbursed the shipping fees. ""It showed what a brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,"" Darcos said. Amazon had lobbied hard against the legislation, worried the French move might set a precedent, the senator said. France's bookstores are concentrated in towns and cities. Amazon said online sales of books had enabled consumers to have equal access, regardless of where they lived. Virtually-free delivery allowed book lovers in rural areas to buy books at the same price as someone who could walk into a bookstore -- precisely the spirit of the 1981 law, it said. Asked when the legislation would be enacted, the Ministry of Culture declined to give a date, saying it was too early to say. For Fornairon, the bookshop owner, the steady stream of U.S. tourists through her door were a constant reminder of the shield French legislation had already wrapped around stores likes hers. ""They say to me 'we didn't even know independent bookstores still existed',"" she said. (REUTERS) Daily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe"

In an interview on US television, Saad Aljabri, who fled Saudi Arabia in May 2017 and is living in exile in Canada, also said he had been warned by an associate in 2018, after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, that a Saudi hit team was heading to Canada to kill him. Aljabri told 60 Minutes on CBS he was warned “don’t be in a proximity of any Saudi mission in Canada. Don’t go to the consulate. Don’t go to the embassy.” When he asked why, he said he was told “they dismembered the guy, they kill him. You are on the top of the list.” 00:43 Saudi crown prince a ‘psychopath’, says exiled intelligence officer Saad Aljabri – video Some details of the alleged murder plot, which were detailed in litigation in the US and Canada, have already been reported. But the 60 Minutes interview represents the first time Aljabri has publicly spoken about his break with Prince Mohammed. He also spoke of the plight of his two youngest children, Sarah and Omar, who were arrested and are in prison in Saudi Arabia in what is widely seen as an attempt to force their father back to the country. “I have to speak out. I am appealing to the American people and to the American administration to help me to release those children and to restore their life,” he said. The Saudi government did not address Aljabri’s allegations but said in a statement that “Saad Aljabri is a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed”. Aljabri was a close adviser to Mohammed bin Nayef, a former crown prince and interior minister who is being held in Saudi Arabia and has been seen as a potential political rival to Prince Mohammed. “I expect to be killed one day because this guy will not rest off until he see me dead,” Aljabri said. Aljabri has strong support in the US, where former intelligence officials have credited their Saudi counterpart for helping to save American and Saudi lives following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. On 60 Minutes, the former acting CIA director Mike Morell said Aljabri was “honourable”. Intelligence relayed to the US by Aljabri – Morell said – had led to the interception of bombs that had been planted by al-Qaida in 2010 in two desktop printers that were being flown as cargo on two planes. Morell said there were also other examples of Aljabri saving the lives of Americans, but that they were still classified. Saudi Arabia has previously denied there was an attempt on Aljabri’s life in Canada. The kingdom has also denied that the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was ordered by Prince Mohammed. But a declassified US intelligence assessment – released earlier this year – concluded the murder was approved by the crown prince. Saad Aljabri. Photograph: Aljabri family/AFP/Getty Images According to Aljabri’s account of alleged plans to assassinate him in Canada, a six-person team landed at Ottawa airport in mid-October 2018, lied to Canadian border officials about knowing one another, and carried suspicious equipment for DNA analysis. The team was deported by Canada after being intercepted by the authorities at the airport. The Canadian government has said: “We are aware of incidents in which foreign actors have attempted to threaten those living in Canada. It is completely unacceptable.” The serious allegations about Prince Mohammed come as Saudi Arabia is seeking to improve its image around the world, including through the recent takeover of Newcastle United by the Public Investment Fund, the Saudi-controlled sovereign wealth fund where Prince Mohammed serves as chairman. In the interview, Aljabri portrayed Prince Mohammed as reckless and untrustworthy. He is, Aljabri said, “a psychopath with no empathy, [who] doesn’t feel emotion, never learned from his experience.” The former intelligence chief also claimed Prince Mohammed “feared” the information Aljabri knew about him, including a 2014 recorded discussion between Prince Mohammed and the then crown prince, Bin Nayef, in which Prince Mohammed allegedly said he could kill the sitting king, Abdullah, to clear the throne for his own father, Salman. “He told him, ‘I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It’s enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done’ … We took it seriously,” Aljabri said. He added that he knew of two copies of the recording, and that he knew where they were located. Saudi Arabia has in turn accused Aljabri of embezzlement and claimed he stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the kingdom’s coffers. The allegations were denied by Aljabri and downplayed by Morell. “I don’t know if Dr Saad was corrupt in any way. I wouldn’t be surprised if he wasn’t because he’s such an honorable man. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if he was. Because everybody to some extent had their hand in the kitty. And King Abdullah allowed it, permitted it,” Morell said."

It did little to stop the spread, documents show","2021-10-25 00:00:00-05","London (CNN) Facebook employees repeatedly sounded the alarm on the company's failure to curb the spread of posts inciting violence in ""at risk"" countries like Ethiopia, where a civil war has raged for the past year, internal documents seen by CNN show. The social media giant ranks Ethiopia in its highest priority tier for countries at risk of conflict, but the documents reveal that Facebook's moderation efforts were no match for the flood of inflammatory content on its platform. The documents are among dozens of disclosures made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. A consortium of 17 US news organizations, including CNN, has reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress. They show employees warning managers about how Facebook was being used by ""problematic actors,"" including states and foreign organizations, to spread hate speech and content inciting violence in Ethiopia and other developing countries, where its user base is large and growing. Facebook estimates it has 1.84 billion daily active users -- 72% of which are outside North America and Europe, according to its annual SEC filing for 2020. The documents also indicate that the company has, in many cases, failed to adequately scale up staff or add local language resources to protect people in these places. Facebook used by militias 'to seed calls for violence' The reports CNN has obtained provide further insights into the scale of the problem in Ethiopia, elements of which were reported by The Wall Street Journal last month. CNN's publication of these warnings from within Facebook comes seven months after a Facebook team initially shared an internal report entitled ""Coordinated Social Harm."" The report, distributed in March, said that armed groups in Ethiopia were using the platform to incite violence against ethnic minorities in the ""context of civil war."" At that time, a conflict in the country's northern Tigray region between its former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the Ethiopian government had been rumbling on for five months. Intermittent internet blackouts and media restrictions had obscured much of the fighting. A destroyed tank on a roadside in western Tigray in May. Ethiopia is an ethnically and religiously diverse nation of about 110 million people who speak scores of languages. Its two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amhara, make up more than 60% of the population. The Tigrayans, the third largest, are around 7%. One of the groups flagged in the March report was the ""Fano,"" an ethnic Amhara militia group with a reputation for brutality that has been drawn into the war in Tigray, sometimes fighting alongside Ethiopian government forces. Facebook said it had observed a cluster of accounts affiliated with the militia group, including some based in Sudan, using its platform to ""seed calls for violence,"" promote armed conflict, recruit and fundraise. Since the war started last November, the Fano militia have been linked by displaced Tigrayans to human rights abuses, including the killings of civilians, looting and rape, according to the United Nations rights office, Amnesty International and other human rights groups. Though the Facebook team said it had recommended the Fano-affiliated network be taken down, it suggested that other bad actors promoting violence on its platform were simultaneously slipping through the cracks. In a headline in bold, the team warned: ""Current mitigation strategies are not enough."" The Facebook documents also detail the platform's removal of a cluster of accounts linked to the Oromo diaspora, mostly based in Egypt, which was targeting Ethiopian audiences with highly inflammatory content, including ""explicit calls to violence against government officials and other ethnic groups."" One inciteful post highlighted in a report shared a photo of what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being lit and the statement: ""Burn the whole country down."" The whistleblower, Haugen, said one of her core motivations for gathering the internal documents was bringing to light ""how badly Facebook is handling places like Ethiopia,"" where she suggested engagement-based ranking was fanning ethnic violence. ""I genuinely fear that a huge number of people are going to die in the next five to ten years, or twenty years, because of choices and underfunding"" by Facebook, Haugen said. In comments made to the consortium, Haugen emphasized the vast difference between the integrity and security systems rolled out by Facebook in the United States versus the rest of the world, adding that the company was not adequately policing its platform in most non-English languages. ""The raw version [of Facebook] roaming wild in most of the world doesn't have any of the things that make it kind of palatable in the United States, and I genuinely think there's a lot of lives on the line -- that Myanmar and Ethiopia are like the opening chapter,"" she said. A Facebook spokesperson told CNN that the company has been ""actively focused on Ethiopia."" ""Over the past two years we have actively invested to add more staff with local expertise, operational resources and additional review capacity to expand the number of local languages we support to include Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya. We have worked to improve our proactive detection so that we can remove more harmful content at scale. We have also partnered extensively with international and local experts to better understand and mitigate the biggest risks on the platform,"" the spokesperson said. Current mitigation strategies are not enough None of the revelations from the Facebook documents are news to activists and human rights groups, who have warned for years that the social media giant has made insufficient efforts to protect human rights in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country. A busy street in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa last December. Some politicians and civil society groups said that if no action was taken, the platform risked repeating the same mistakes it made in Myanmar -- now a case study in the deadly impact that hate speech shared on Facebook can have. In 2018, the UN slammed Facebook's role in the Myanmar crisis, which the global body said, ""bore the hallmarks of genocide."" By promoting violence and hatred against the minority Rohingya population, the UN said Facebook had ""turned into a beast."" The social media company later acknowledged that it didn't do enough to prevent its platform being used to fuel bloodshed, and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote an open letter apologizing to activists and promising to increase its moderation efforts. Much like in Myanmar, Facebook's rise in popularity in Ethiopia came at a moment of rapid political and societal change, which helped to boost the platform's growth. In 2018, Abiy Ahmed was appointed Prime Minister and launched a series of reforms, including freeing thousands of political prisoners and lifting restrictions on the press. But as Ethiopians began to use Facebook to engage in public debate, observers saw that the platform was being abused by a variety of actors, including politicians, to incite discrimination and violence. Former UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression David Kaye told CNN that this problem came up repeatedly in conversations with civil society groups during his trip to Ethiopia in December 2019: ""It was on everybody's radar that there could be real spill over from the platform to offline harm."" ""Given the experience in Myanmar, it was really incumbent on Facebook to do a human rights impact assessment and evaluate what they needed to do so that Facebook in Ethiopia didn't become a place for incitement to violence,"" Kaye said, adding that he didn't know what that assessment looked like or if it was done. In June 2020, a Facebook employee posted a report to an internal group with about 1,500 members called ""At Risk Countries FYI"" recapping an ongoing audit into how well its Artificial Intelligence and other signals, like third party fact checkers, worked in the most at-risk countries where the platform operates. ""We found significant gaps in our coverage (especially in Myanmar & Ethiopia), showcasing that our current signals may be inadequate,"" the employee wrote, sharing a spreadsheet with a list of at-risk countries and the languages supported by the platform in each. The spreadsheet showed that Facebook had failed to build automated systems, called classifiers, to detect misinformation or hate speech in Oromo or Amharic -- two of the most widely spoken languages spoken in Ethiopia. A Tigrayan man looks for cellular service on a mountain overlooking Um Rakuba refugee camp in eastern Sudan in January. Even as the conflict in Tigray escalated, Haugen said she had only found evidence that Facebook had allocated ""even slight language support"" in two of the country's many native languages. Facebook says it does not believe it should be the ""arbiters of truth,"" so the firm relies on third-party fact-checking organizations to identify, review and rate potential misinformation on its platforms. Facebook has partnered with two such organizations in Ethiopia: AFP Fact Check and PesaCheck, an East Africa-based non-profit initiative run by Code for Africa. PesaCheck has five full-time Ethiopian fact-checkers working in four languages -- Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya and English -- but says it recently had to relocate one staff member from Ethiopia due to intimidation. AFP Fact Check employs one fact-checker in Ethiopia, Amanuel Neguede, who reviews content in Amharic and English. Each day, Neguede told CNN that he reviews thousands of posts on an internal Facebook tool, which surfaces content flagged as false or misleading through a combination of AI and human moderators. Originally, Neguede said that AFP only had access to English-language content in Ethiopia through the tool, which would surface only limited content each day. The tool began serving AFP Amharic-language content in May, and now the number of claims he says he sees on a daily basis has drastically risen. The tool does not always accurately identify mis- and dis-information, but Neguede says it helps with his work. ""I've seen a lot of a lot of hate speech, that definitely does fuel ethnic violence in Ethiopia,"" Neguede said. ""Whenever there's a major offensive, for example that's happening in the north, we can see a lot of images of conflict that's happened in different countries used in a misleading context. I would say that most of the time we'll see posts surface -- especially posts that are widely shared -- after real news events."" But researchers like Berhan Taye say Facebook in Ethiopia is in desperate need of more content moderators, pointing to how the platform was used to stoke a wave of deadly violence after the murder of Oromo musician Hachalu Hundessa last year. Taye, then a policy manager at digital rights group Access Now, recalls watching livestreams of lynchings and posts calling for the targeted extermination of certain ethnic groups, following Hundessa's death. She penned an open letter calling on Facebook to take action to protect Ethiopians. She says little has changed since. Buldings burned by a mob in Ethiopia's Oromo region during a wave of violence following Hachalu Hundessa's murder last July. For that reason, Taye, now an independent Nairobi-based analyst, works with grassroots volunteers to collate misinformation and hate speech they spot on the platform into Excel spreadsheets, which they then send on to Facebook for removal. But she says that much of what they flag -- including posts calling for the extermination of certain ethnic groups -- does not get taken down and, occasionally, the company has responded to activists asking for them to translate posts. Facebook says it has improved its reporting tools for people in Ethiopia to make it faster and easier for them to report content they believe violates its community standards, which are now available in Amharic and recently launched in Oromo. It says it has also established reporting channels for international and local human rights groups and civil society organizations to flag potentially harmful content in Ethiopia. Content moderation is extremely dangerous work in Ethiopia, Taye says, adding that she has personally been accused of siding with a person or group because a post was removed. The task is also mentally exhausting; volunteers spend hours reviewing graphic content, often doing it alongside full-time jobs and raising their kids. Taye said it was unacceptable that poor people have effectively been left to the ""dirty work"" of one of the world's richest companies. Facebook will not reveal exactly how many local language speakers are evaluating content in Ethiopia that has been flagged as possibly violating its standards, or how much it has invested in resources to better police its platform in the country. A Facebook spokesperson said the company had invested ""$13 billion and have 40,000 people working on the safety and security on our platform, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages working in more than 20 locations all across the world to support our community. Our third party fact-checking program includes over 80 partners who review content in over 60 languages, and 70 of those fact checkers are outside of the US."" ""Our track record shows that we crack down on abuse outside the US with the same intensity that we apply in the US,"" the spokesperson added. A war on social media Since war broke out in Tigray, supporters of both the government and TPLF have waged a parallel fight on social media, creating a virtual battleground of toxic ethnic and religious hatred. But it's difficult to determine when atrocities unfolding on the ground are the direct result of hateful content shared online. The head of the US Agency for International Development Samantha Power expressed concern in August about the ""inflamed"" and ""dehumanizing rhetoric"" that she said Ethiopia's leaders were invoking amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces were described by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as ""weeds"" and ""cancer"" in a post shared on Facebook. Power emphasized that ""increasingly virulent speech"" used by the prime minister and other officials, also shared on social media, ""often accompanies ethnically-motivated atrocities."" Abiy's language was also condemned by the UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu , who warned that ""hate speech, together with its propagation through social media is part of a worrisome trend that contributes to further fuel ethnic tensions in the country."" Activists say that divisive language has been echoed by Abiy's supporters online. CNN has reached out to the Ethiopian prime minister's office for comment. In June, days before Ethiopia's national elections, which Abiy won in a landslide, Facebook said it removed a network of fake accounts targeting domestic users primarily in Amharic. Facebook linked the accounts to individuals associated with Ethiopia's Information Network Security Agency (INSA), the cybersecurity agency that Abiy established and ran before becoming Prime Minister. People watch Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's swearing-in ceremony at an Addis Ababa coffee shop in October. A Facebook page with an INSA-affiliated administrator was also flagged in internal Facebook documents in March, but was not recommended for removal. As the conflict escalates online and off, the Ethiopian government has accused Facebook of blocking user and removing posts ""disseminating the true reality about Ethiopia."""

The relationship between China and Russia has evolved in ways where they're trying to intimidate other nations with their actions that don't abide by a rules based international order, Carlos Del Toro told reporters in a phone briefing in Tokyo, where he is meeting Japanese government and military officials. Last Monday, 10 Chinese and Russian warships passed through the Tsugaru Strait that runs between Japan's main Honshu island and the island of Hokkaido, Japanese Defense Ministry Joint Staff said in a statement. The same 10 ships sailed westward through the Osumi Strait in the southern prefecture of Kagoshima on Friday, in effect circumnavigating Japan in an unprecedented provocative move. It's necessary to certainly deter them from bullying other countries and being aggressors in any possible way. We want to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific, Del Toro said. Japan's government is watching with great interest the activities of Chinese and Russian warships around Japan, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told reporters last week. We will take nothing for granted in our warning and surveillance activities in the air and sea domains around Japan. The straits the warships passed through only count three nautical miles from each shore as international waters, as opposed to the nautical 12 miles, leaving the central portion of the narrow strait as territorial waters. This is said to be a Cold War relic that let Japanese vessels carrying nuclear weapons pass through, without violating principles that prohibit the introduction of nuclear weapons into American territory. Del Toro said that the U.S. would seek to deter such provocations by continuing to remind China and Russia that good nations abide by a rules-based international order. When nations behave aggressively in violation of other countries' expanded economic zones, for example, all these actions lead to behavior that simply cannot be tolerated. The navy secretary has met with Japanese officials including Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi and Gen. Koji Yamazaki, Chief of Staff of the Japan Self-Defense Forces Joint Staff. The U.S. Department of Defense is conducting a posture review to determine if the military has the correct number of troops in the correct places. Del Toro said the review would be completed by the end of this year or early 2022, but declined to say whether more activity can be expected in terms of transits or navigation operations through the Taiwan Strait. We are going to do everything as a navy to be as forward-leaning as possible to ensure that we can protect our country's national security and economic interests, and those of our allies and partners, he said. And so, all bets are on the table with regard to what we're looking at, and we're going to work very closely with our partners to position ourselves, collectively together, basically, to be able to deter, China, or any other country that presents itself in ways contrary to our national security interest. Del Toro, born in Cuba and came to the U.S. as a refugee as a child, was sworn in as 78th Secretary of the Navy in August. S. alliance for regional security. We all share this common desire that all free nations maintain the rules-based international order, it's so very important to ensure that we maintain open lines of communication and freedoms for each of these nations to pursue their own economic interests."

Moscow schools are also closed, and unvaccinated over-60s in the capital have been ordered to lock down for four months. Vaccine scepticism is high across central and eastern Europe, and as a result the region has become a hotspot.

Confrontations over Xinjiang between China and mostly Western countries, including the United States, have become a regular occurrence at both the U.N. General Assembly in New York and the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. ADVERTISEMENT In a statement – part of which was read by French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière to the General Assembly rights committee – 43 countries voiced concern about increasing “reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations,” accusing China of detaining more than 1 million people in camps. They said the abuse accusations included “reports documenting torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, forced sterilization, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced separation of children.” Beijing denies all allegations of abuse of Uyghurs and describes the camps as vocational training facilities to combat religious extremism. China’s U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, hit back in a statement partly read to the rights committee on Thursday. “To the U.S. and a few other countries: Your desperate attempts to cover up your own terrible human rights record will not work,” he said. “No matter how many times repeated, lies are still lies,” he added. “You are using human rights as a pretext for political maneuvering to provoke confrontation.” U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has been negotiating access to Xinjiang since September 2018. She told the Human Rights Council in June that she hoped to agree on terms for a visit this year to examine reports of serious violations against Muslim Uyghurs. At the Human Rights Council in June, more than 40 countries urged China to give Bachelet immediate access. gsg Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

While organ trafficking exists in all regions of the world, it is of particular concern in North and West Africa where impoverished communities and displaced populations are at greater risk of exploitation. The strategic assessment report, produced as part of Project ENACT, provides insight and analysis into the issues, to enable law enforcement agencies in North and West Africa to devise the appropriate responses. Transplant tourism Organized crime groups are known to be behind trafficking in human beings for organ removal, drawn by the substantial profits that can be made. Information suggests a wide spectrum of actors are involved in organ trafficking in North and West Africa with connections to the medical sector in countries from Africa and beyond, notably in Asia and the Middle East. Trafficking in human organs can be done only in the framework of complex networks, due to the required skills (medical specialists, surgeons, nurses), logistics (matching compatible patients and donors), and healthcare facilities (analytical laboratories, clinics, operating rooms). The report shows probable links between transplant tourism – where a patient travels abroad to buy an organ for illegal transplant – and THBOR in North and West Africa. Either in the context of transplants performed in North Africa with organs illegally sourced in the region, or transplants done elsewhere with illegally sourced organs from nationals from North and West Africa. Vulnerable communities Organized criminal groups profit from the desperation of the unemployed, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees to coerce them into selling an organ. Victims of human trafficking for sexual and labour purposes also find themselves at additional risk. The techniques used for the recruitment and control of the victims are the same as those used for other types of human trafficking, such as promises of job opportunities abroad, as well as the use of threats and violence. Most often, victim-donors receive a smaller amount of the money than had been agreed with the recruiter or broker, and in some cases they may not get any of the promised payment. Many victim-donors have suffered post-operative complications and health issues. The socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to fuel THBOR as it will likely be easier for brokers to coerce vulnerable individuals to sell an organ to improve their economic conditions. This is exacerbated by the fact that legal organ donations, and therefore transplants, have suffered major decreases since the outbreak of COVID-19. Actionable intelligence “While trafficking in human beings for organ removal is not a new phenomenon, it is underreported due to the clandestine nature of the crime, combined with a lack of awareness by law enforcement agencies and the deficiency of information sharing channels between the medical and police sectors,” said Cyril Gout, INTERPOL’s Direct of Operational Support and Analysis. “This strategic assessment provides INTERPOL member countries with actionable strategic intelligence on THBOR in North and West Africa and will further facilitate law enforcement cooperation among the countries affected,” added Mr Gout. The report supports law enforcement agencies to set priorities, so as to identify potential victims, investigate trafficking in human being cases that are motivated by the organ trade, and target the criminal networks that facilitate THBOR. Project ENACT Project ENACT (Enhancing Africa’s Response to Transnational Organised Crime) seeks to assist police in Africa to adopt proactive strategies to combat organized crime threats, facilitate information exchange and enhance investigative skills. Project ENACT is funded by the European Union and implemented by INTERPOL and the Institute for Security Studies, in partnership with the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime."

Now, there are only eight. A local feast celebrating Saint Michael the Archangel, patron saint of the town, used to run for two days, with heaps of food and celebratory banda, regional Mexican music. There is no feast this year — only three men dressing up a statue of the saint between cleaning a church. El Cajón is one of the hundreds of villages near the U.S. border transformed into ghost towns by crime and violence that force people to flee, either to other parts of the country or to the United States. The village has around 60 abandoned houses riddled with bullet holes, surrounded by grass and forgotten belongings. People left everything behind after brutal attacks by Mexican drug cartels. Abandoned school in El Cajon. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center in Mexico, there were 9,700 new displacements due to conflict in 2020, bringing the total count of people displaced within Mexico to 357,000 people as of last December. About 24,000 displaced migrants, most from Michoacán, are expected to go to Tijuana to pursue asylum in the United States, according to recent coverage from the news organization Border Report. “Over the past two decades, the ways criminal groups exercise violence, and against whom, have changed profoundly in Mexico,"" said Falko Ernst, a senior security analyst for the International Crisis Group responsible for conducting research on the country’s lethal conflict. ""Criminal groups have moved toward deep territorial penetration. They're seeking to control not only the land but also populations."" Strategically speaking, Ernst said, criminal groups clearly recognize how essential it is to get local civilians on their side. Sometimes, they try to entice people with displays of benevolence like handouts. But more often, they threaten people with coercion and violence.

Tierra Caliente Story continues In September, Mexico-based journalists traveled for The Courier Journal to the Tierra Caliente (Hot Land) region of Michoacán to document the forced displacement in one of the most hazardous and forgotten places in the country. In this area, the ongoing conflict between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), Los Viagras drug cartel, and armed self-defense groups has led to countless deaths, thousands of internally displaced people, and growing numbers of people seeking to flee across the U.S. border. CJNG is the bloodiest and most powerful drug cartel in Mexico. The U.S. State Department has issued a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of its leader, Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, also known as ""El Mencho."" An abandoned car with bullet holes nearby El Cajon. 'El Mencho': A ruthless Mexican drug lord’s empire is devastating families with its grip on small-town USA After being granted access to the CJNG area, the journalists saw men who identified themselves as a self-defense group, armed civilians protecting themselves from drug cartels, but who locals said were cartel members. After driving 40 minutes on rough roads, journalists noticed a Mexican military barracks in the middle of the road, with .50-caliber weapons pointing toward the next city, El Mencho's lawless birthplace of Aguililla. There, the isolation was palpable, with empty roads and abandoned houses. Armed men stood near blockades in the road, deciding who to allow into the area, which is considered CJNG territory. An abandoned house nearby El Aguaje, on the fence, you can read, CJNG letters which mean Jalisco New Generation Cartel. While in El Aguaje, a tall man stepped out of a pickup truck stamped with the letters CJNG and approached the journalists. Three other men remained inside the vehicle. ""Who are you?"" asked the tall man, who was holding a long weapon. “We're journalists,” photographer Cristopher Rogel Blanquet answered. “Your group granted us permission to be here."" The man asked what they were doing there, and Blanquet told him they were pursuing a story about forced displacement due to violence. The man answered: ""Got it. Just keep in mind that this is a war between cartels…” Where do Mexican drug cartels get their guns? Often, the United States Journalists learned that some of the former inhabitants of this area and other parts of Michoacán had to flee to a neighboring Mexican state. Many hope to someday return. ""They're hoping the situation in their home communities stabilizes and the violence diminishes,"" said Dana Graber Ladek, chief of mission at the International Organization for Migration in Mexico. ""If they're fleeing violence and seeking safety, it's also a very stressful and undesirable situation for these individuals to be in.” Other residents seek asylum in the United States, many of them without success.

Over 900,000 migrants trying to cross the border have been expelled under COVID-related rules that went into effect in March 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol figures show. A 40-year-old-man from El Cajón, who would not give his name because he feared for his safety, said he hasn't left the village because his sister and his uncle are among the eight people remaining. Because there’s no place to work, he said he survives on money sent by family members now living in the United States. ""It was hard to live over a year without power and running water,” the man told journalists. “I didn't want to leave because I still have to take care of my sister and my uncle, and not to leave them all. There are sick people here, elderly, I don't need to live (like) this, but I do it for them. We're a family now.” Migration and deep scars Experts said it’s impossible to know the true scale of displacement in a country where conflict continues to increase and the government hasn’t done enough to address the root causes. “It's difficult to assess whether the phenomenon is becoming more common or simply whether displacement is becoming more visible,"" said Alvaro Sardiza, monitoring expert for the Americas at the International Displacement Monitoring Center. Graber Ladek said Mexico is a “very unique country in terms of migration dynamics” because of its geography and where it is located. ""It's also a major country of transit, so there are many individuals who are passing through Mexico, the majority of those who have the U.S. as their destination,” she said. “And of course, it's a country of return. Those people who are just deported, expelled, or choose to return to Mexico."" Interior of an abandoned house in the community of El Cajón. The people who lived there left because of the war between criminal groups fighting over the region. Drug distribution: A Detroit pipeline targets North Dakota Native Americans. How they’re fighting back While there are other reasons for forced displacement in Mexico, the presence of heavily armed and powerful crime organizations is a big one. Throughout the years, Michoacán has been a strategic place for criminal organizations to boost their illegal businesses. It’s home to the Lázaro Cárdenas port, a gateway for shipments of precursor chemicals from Asia used in the production of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl. Battles for territory have left deep scars on innocent Mexicans who are not involved in the drug trade. ""We're civilians; we're not involved in any of the conflicts,” said the 40-year-old El Cajón resident. “It's tough because you can't go out, or they would think that you're supporting a side or the other. We spent over two months hiding because of shootings.” As drug cartels grow more powerful and gain territory, more Mexicans are forced to either live this way or leave their homes. Experts say the state and federal governments are not doing enough to help restore law and order. ""Mexico's federal and state forces have acted, in the best of cases, as passive bystanders, and in the worst of cases as active conflict participants, taking sides by collaborating with one or the other criminal band,"" said Ernst, the security analyst. Eduardo's uncle, an older adult who also stayed in El Cajón. ""For now, the name of the game is passiveness and complicity, and this means that these new, more aggressive ways of making war – such as the deliberate targeting of civilian populations – are afforded with impunity."" If criminal organizations face no consequences, Ernst said, “the escalation of violent practices will continue” and “humanitarian costs, including displacements too, will continue to mount."" Mexican drug cartels: As cartels muscle in on massive avocado sales, armed civilians fight back Experts said federal government officials are drafting legislation that aims to prevent internal displacement. But for now, they expect the problem to fester. Back in El Cajón, the 40-year-old resident tries to remain optimistic. ""Right now, we feel free because shootings have stopped,"" he said. “Maybe next year, things would get better. Probably with fewer people, but the patronal feast could happen again.""

The enormous skeleton, estimated to be over 66 million years old, was found in 2014 in South Dakota. The triceratops is known for its three horns on the head. Big John, named after the owner of the land where it was found, is certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest documented skeleton of a triceratops. The dinosaur died in an ancient flood plain on the island continent stretching from present-day Alaska to Mexico, allowing the conservation of its skeleton in mud. The skeleton is 7.15 meters long (23 feet) and stands 2.7 meters high (8 feet) at the hips. The skull represents more than one third of its total length, with two large horns over 1.1 meter long (3.6 feet). The hammer price at the Drouot auction house, before commission and other costs, was 5.5 million euros. “It’s a record for Europe,"" auctioneer Alexandre Giquello said. Big John's skeleton is more than 60% complete and its skull more than 75% complete, making it unique. “The overall quality of Big John really deserved this price,"" Iacopo Briano, a paleontology expert, said. “For a triceratops and for an herbivore. This is unbelievable record,” he said. Last year, a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton reached almost $32 million in an auction in New York, becoming the most expensive dinosaur ever sold. Big John was sold to a private U.S. buyer who requested to remain anonymous. Djuan Rivers, a representative for the buyer, said “it’s being acquired by an American collector... absolutely thrilled with the idea of being able to bring a piece like this to his personal use.” “The history behind this and the duration of it is absolutely impressive. So to be able to be a part of preserving something of this nature... it’s also something extremely special,"" Rivers added."

For years, researchers said it might not be possible to remove the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, but now, one non-profit is proving them wrong. In July, The Ocean Cleanup, which has been developing a system to help clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, took its first large-scale cleanup system, called System 002, or Jenny, to the Pacific. They conducted a series of tests over the course of 12 weeks, each one consisting of the system being taken offshore to safely gather plastic from the ocean. The organization completed its final test of the system last week, and on October 14, The Ocean Cleanup tweeted it had gathered 9,000 kilograms — more than 19,841 pounds — of debris.

That system, they said, is expected to be ""three times larger"" than the current one. ""While it's just the tip of the iceberg, these kilograms are the most important ones we will ever collect, because they are proof that cleanup is possible,"" Slat said in the release. ""We still have a lot of things to iron out, but one thing we know now is that, with a small fleet of these systems, we can clean this up."" The Ocean Cleanup says the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of the largest marine debris patches in the world. In 2018, research estimated that there are at least 79,000 tons of plastic inside a 1.6 million-square-kilometer area. Microplastics — plastic materials smaller than 5 centimeters — make up roughly 8% of the mass, but 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of debris floating in the area, researchers found. Marine garbage patches such as the one in the Pacific are large areas where debris collects, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The aquatic piles are formed by rotating currents called ""gyres,"" which are like ""big whirlpools that pull objects in."" There are five gyres in the ocean — one in the Indian, two in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific — and each gyre contains garbage patches of different sizes. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the most famous of these piles. Jenny works by two boats slowly guiding a U-shaped barrier through the polluted area. According to the organization, the circulating currents in the garbage patch move the plastic around, and their system helps guide that plastic into the system's retention zone. Once the system is full, workers empty the plastic on the marine vessel. After they gather as much debris as they can during the excursion, workers take the plastic to shore to recycle, and The Ocean Cleanup reuses some of the materials gathered to make products. The system is designed to gather even microplastics, which are just millimeters in size. The Ocean Cleanup also designed the system to be animal friendly. The boats tow it at roughly 1.5 miles per hour, so that marine life can easily swim in, out and around, and there are quick release systems, escape routes, cameras and lights to help animals escape the netting. Crew members also monitor marine life interactions. Slat believes that about 10 upscaled systems could clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and that they could remove 50% of it in the first 5 years. Slat said that many aspects need to be finessed, but that a fleet of The Ocean Cleanup's systems could clean it up. If properly deployed, the organization predicts it could remove 90% of all floating ocean plastic by 2040. On Wednesday, the organization also said the cleanup method will offset all carbon emissions with the aim of reaching carbon neutrality. Traditional cleanup methods, the organization says on its website, have a ""staggeringly high"" CO2 footprint. But their systems, they said, are ""100% powered by the natural forces of nature,"" as it uses natural currents and solar energy. The vessel itself, the organization said, is the only aspect of the system that requires fuel. But the organization's mission has been met with some criticism from fellow climate activists and experts. In September, Miriam Goldstein, director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress, told Reuters that The Ocean Cleanup is ""coming from a good place,"" but that priorities should be set on preventing plastic from entering the ocean. ""Once plastic has gotten into open ocean, it becomes very expensive and fossil-fuel intensive to get it back out again,"" Goldstein said. While the organization was able to scoop up a massive haul of trash, more than 24 trillion pounds of plastic is dumped into oceans ever year, according to a 2020 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And without immediate and sustained action, the annual flow of pollution could nearly triple by 2040 — when The Ocean Cleanup says it could have the majority of floating plastics removed — the study said. ""Without meaningful change, about 4 billion people worldwide are likely to be without organized waste collection services by 2040, contributing significantly to the projected amount of ocean plastic pollution,"" Pew said in a press release. ""Closing this gap would require connecting more than 500,000 people to collection services per day until 2040."""

A recent study narrows down the date of the Norse arrival in North America to as early as 1021 CE, based on scraps of discarded wood from the site and with help from the aftermath of an ancient solar storm. Vikings and cosmic rays In the early 1200s, Icelandic authors wrote down two sagas describing Norse explorers’ trips to a place called Vinland. The expeditions had happened about two centuries earlier. Based on those sagas and the types of artifacts left behind at L’Anse aux Meadows, archaeologists today generally agree that the Norse arrived sometime near the end of the 1st millennium CE. For a few years (between three and 10), the Norse settlers used the site as a base for explorations farther south—and then they left. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from L’Anse aux Meadows suggests that the Viking Age came to American shores sometime between 975 and 1020 CE. To narrow down when the Norse arrived in Newfoundland, University of Groningen chronologists Michael Dee and Margot Kuitems, along with their colleagues, looked for evidence of the year a solar storm bombarded Earth’s atmosphere with radiation. In late 992 and early 993 CE, people in Korea, Germany, and Ireland all mentioned vibrant red auroras dancing in the night sky. Trees around the world trapped an unusually high amount of carbon-14 in their growth rings the following year. Carbon-14 forms in the upper atmosphere when highly energized particles called cosmic rays collide with nitrogen molecules. Usually, those cosmic rays come from events outside our Solar System, toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, but physicists blame the 993 CE event on our own Sun. Advertisement Dendrochronologists (scientists who measure and date tree rings) discovered the carbon-14 spike and dated it to 993 CE in trees from sites around the world. Dee, Kuitems, and their colleagues recently used it as a landmark to help pinpoint the age of three wood fragments from L’Anse aux Meadows. The fragments, which come from three different trees (a mixture of juniper and fir), were cast-off cuts of wood discarded by the Norse, but all still bear cut marks from iron tools. “We imagine they were refuse from construction projects or indeed just the clearance of land,” Dee told Ars. All three wood fragments included at least part of a tree’s outermost ring (tree-ring enthusiasts call this the ""waney layer""). That confirmed the fragments came from felled trees, not driftwood, whose bark would have been stripped away by the ocean. It also meant that Dee, Kuitems, and their colleagues could date the exact year the trees were cut down."

One unit of the plant is said to have been shut down in response. In a statement, an emergency services representative told RIA Novosti that “Unit Two at Rostov Nuclear Power Plant has been shut down and put on maintenance because of a steam leak.” The facility is located in the town of Volgodonsk, some 200km east of the regional capital, Rostov-on-don. According to the source, no injuries are reported due to the incident, the levels of radiation are safe, and the plant’s three remaining reactors are operating normally. An investigation has reportedly been launched. The plant’s press service has since told Moscow daily RBK that “at 00:54am, in the technical room of power unit Number Two, a spike was detected. According to the approved protocols, the power unit’s capacity was decreased by disconnecting it from the network. The reactor plant is currently in cool down mode. Work is underway on the thermal mechanical equipment. “The radiation background at the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant is at a level corresponding to the normal operation of the reactors and does not exceed naturally-occurring background values.” READ MORE: Emergency shutdown at Russia's Kursk nuclear plant Another source told Interfax that a leak occurred due to a micro-crack on one of the conduits carrying pressurized steam. “This is the so-called secondary circuit, heat exchange equipment,” RIA Novosti quoted a plant official as saying. “It carries pure steam, where, in principle, there is no radioactivity.” However, later on Thursday, the plant’s management denied that any leaks had been discovered and said that the reactor was “disconnected” due to problems with the network. According to them, the decision was taken after “an urgent request to carry out routine maintenance on heat and power equipment.” The foundations for the Rostov Nuclear Plant were laid in 1977 as part of the Soviet Union’s national energy program. Construction on Unit Two began in 1983, but work on the reactor was not completed until 2010.

Human Rights Committee says the Paraguayan government failed to stop the illegal use of pesticides being sprayed on the land of the Ava Guarani Indigenous community. For more than a decade, the fumigation from neighboring soybean plantations killed the community’s plants and animals, while creating health issues for many residents. As a result, younger generations of Ava Guarani were unable to learn the community’s cultural customs, and many moved away from the community. Paraguay has the laws and institutions in place to regulate commercial agriculture but has demonstrated an unwillingness to apply them, according to the committee. The United Nations’ Human Rights Committee has found that the Paraguayan government failed to regulate the use of harmful chemicals near an Indigenous community, resulting in severe health issues and the degradation of its culture. The OHCHR said the government didn’t adequately respond to credible complaints made by the Ava Guarani people about two nearby properties illegally fumigating genetically modified soybeans. The chemicals leaked onto Ava Guarani land and upended traditional customs. “Serious environmental damages have severe impacts on indigenous people’s family life, tradition, identity and even lead to the disappearance of their community,” said committee member Hélène Tigroudja. “It dramatically harms the existence of the culture of the group as a whole.” In the complaint, the community said the runoff had killed many of its animals, including chickens and ducks, while also hurting its crops and poisoning the surrounding land and waters. Unable to hunt, fish or forage as they once had, the Ava Guarani had no choice but to stop many of their traditional ceremonies, the decision said. They couldn’t build their jerokyha dance houses without the proper forest materials, or prepare kagüi, a special liquor, because many of the ingredients had disappeared. Without these ceremonies, and as the years passed without government action, children in the community stopped learning Ava Guarani traditions. Other community members moved off the land in search of healthier, more sustainable places to live. The committee also said that the commercial farming activity had violated the Ava Guarani’s sense of “home,” the definition of which includes relationships with territory, livestock, crops and other ways of life. “‘Home’ is not only the traditional Western conception of an apartment or a house,” Tigroudja told Mongabay. “It may also include different elements of the way of living of Indigenous communities. It’s really an opening up of the definition that is more inclusive to Indigenous peoples.” She added, “We hope that when other human rights bodies deal with the same kind of issues, they will use this definition of ‘home’ as a roadmap.” The Ava Guarani community, located in Paraguay’s Canindeyú department on the border with Brazil, first filed a complaint with local authorities in 2009, claiming that the fumigation was causing health problems for many of its 201 residents. Officials carried out onsite visits, interviews and environmental hazard tests over the course of five years, but never took concrete action to stop the fumigation, according to the complaint. Paraguay’s Public Ministry did not respond to Mongabay’s request for comment. The Curuguaty municipal government could not be reached. It wasn’t until 2019, after several complaints had been filed and the Ava Guarani’s case had ground to a halt, that community leaders turned to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, an international body made up of 18 independent human rights experts. Although the committee doesn’t have the legal authority to compel Paraguay to act, it offered a stern reminder that the country is legally obligated to address the Ava Guarani’s situation. Tigroudja pointed out that Paraguay is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees individuals effective legal remedies when their human rights have been violated. “Politically speaking, it’s up to the state to decide to apply our decision or not,” she said. “I really hope they do because the extensive use of pesticides in Paraguay is dramatic. It’s not a new situation.” Over the last 30 years, Paraguay’s economy has increasingly relied on commercial agriculture, especially soybeans and beef from cattle ranching. In 2019, the country exported $1.58 billion of soybeans and nearly $1 billion in beef, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. But economic gains have often come at the expense of Indigenous communities, who suffer from some of the world’s worst land distribution inequality, the result of decades of agrarian reform programs that, in some cases, gifted land to power players close to the government. Between 1987 and 2012, Paraguay deforested nearly 40,000 square kilometers (17,000 square miles) of forest and grassland, while registering around 87% land use change, according to one study. “Paraguayan commercial agriculture is capital and land intensive, characterized by heavy equipment and agrichemicals, and for these reasons, it has become a symbol of national progress for the country’s elites,” said Warren Thompson, an anthropologist who has been working with Paraguayan Indigenous communities for more than a decade. “Yet it is worth asking who wins and who loses in this ‘success.’” President Mario Abdo has made some efforts to return land to internally displaced Indigenous communities while also ensuring his government adheres to a strict zero-deforestation law. The government last year also implemented a deforestation monitoring system. Yet despite these efforts, and the fact that the country has many other laws and institutions in place to help regulate commercial agriculture, the U.N. committee said there’s a lack of political willingness in the Paraguayan government when economic gains start to threaten local communities. “The domestic avenues do exist but they are not effective,” Tigroudja said, “and when the government receives these complaints, what we have seen is that it doesn’t do anything on the administrative level or on the criminal level.” Citations: Baumann, M., Israel, C., Piquer-Rodríguez, M., Gavier-Pizarro, G., Volante, J.

South Korea has successfully launched its first domestically-built space rocket on Thursday, but its dummy satellite did not make it to orbit in a bittersweet surprise result for the country's first all-domestic test launch, according to an initial report from AP News. But this still represents a colossal leap forward for the peninsular nation's space ambitions. South Korea's first test launch successfully reached space South Korea's first test flight to space saw a three-stage KSLV-II Nuri rocket lift into the stratosphere emblazoned with the country's national flag from the Naro Space Center at 4:00 AM EDT. The Nuri rocket, which means ""world"" in Korean, was developed to loft 1.65-ton payloads to orbit 370 to 500 miles (600 to 800 km) above the planet's surface, and serve as an integral part of South Korea's wider ambitions to greatly expand its space program. This will include the launch of satellites for navigation, communications, surveillance, and even lunar probes on a long enough timeline. The country's President Moon Jae-in watched the launch from the nearby space center, and confirmed that the rocket had successfully completed its initial flight sequences, but failed to send the test payload into orbit. ""Unfortunately, we did not fully reach our goal,"" said Moon in a speech at the site of the launch, according to a Reuters report. The S. Korean president gave adulation to the workers involved in the launch, and said the project would continue to press further despite the incomplete results of Thursday's test. ""It's not long before we'll be able to launch it exactly into the target trajectory,"" he said, according to a transcript. ""The 'Korea Space Age' is approaching."" Officials also said the final stage of the rocket shut down 40 to 50 seconds early, which prevented the payload from achieving sufficient velocity to reach the targeted orbital trajectory. While the cause of this early shutdown is still under investigation, officials think it could have been a premature command from control computers, a lack of pressure inside the fuel tank, or other crucial variables. Advertisement There's still time to ace a test launch ""Today's launch left some disappointment, but it is significant as it was the first test of the launch vehicle independently developed with our own technology,"" said South Korea's Minister Lim Hye-sook of Science and Technology during a briefing, reported in Reuters. ""It's meaningful to confirm that all major launch steps were carried out and we have secured core technology."" As the briefing came to a close, one of the officials, overwhelmed with emotion, bowed, and said: ""Please support us to make the launch successful in May next year."" This near-miss of a test flight was supervised by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which moved the 220-ton rocket into its liftoff site on the launch pad on Wednesday, before lifting it into its final position, hoisted to a giant green support structure, all stationed on the launch pad near cliffs that drop sharply into the sea. All three of the rocket's stages used liquid-fuel boosters manufactured by an affiliate of South Korea's Hanwha conglomerate. Two pairs of roughly 83-ton boosers were used in the second stage, and a single, 7.7-ton rocket was used in the spacecraft's final stage. This launch may have not completed every goal of KARI, but the agency aims to execute up to five more test launches before the rocket begins its payload workflow. So there's still time to ace a launch, the next of which is slated for May 19, 2021."

Two of three Paraguayan leather exporters shown to be buying hides from cattle grazed in illegally deforested parts of the Gran Chaco have increased their sales to Europe since the issue came to light in September 2020. Major European automakers are still unable to demonstrate how their supply chains are shielded from illegal deforestation in Paraguay. The forests of the Gran Chaco in Paraguay continue to be the target of illegal deforestation, prompting one of the world’s last uncontacted Indigenous nations to reportedly reach out to express their concern over the continued encroachment by outsiders. In September 2020, an investigation by London-based NGO Earthsight exposed the link between the illegal clearances inside PNCAT, a protected territory that’s home to the Ayoreo Totobiegosode people, for cattle ranching, and the leather used by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. The report revealed that two ranches within PNCAT — Caucasian SA, and a farm belonging to an associate of Cooperativa Chortitzer — were found to have illegally cleared more than 2,700 and 500 hectares respectively (6,700 and 1,200 acres) between 2018 and 2019. After the report was made public, Earthsight, along with local and international NGOs, called on Paraguayan authorities to investigate the cases of illegal deforestation at the Caucasian and Chortitzer farms, as well as whether the more than 200 fires at Caucasian in 2020 were in breach of the law. In a follow-up report released last week, “Grand Theft Chaco II: The Vice Continues,” Earthsight said Paraguayan authorities had failed to investigate the exposed illegalities, resulting in new cases of illegal deforestation in the Gran Chaco. Analysis of satellite data provided to Earthsight by Global Forest Watch showed that forest clearing for agriculture has continued inside PNCAT. At least two new areas were cleared between 2020 and April 2021, and around 100 hectares (250 acres) of this clearing took place in densely forested land. “The Paraguayan authorities haven’t just ignored the evidence of illegalities. Without bothering to check the facts, they have sought to defend the companies responsible,” Earthsight said. Paraguay’s environment ministry and enforcement agency in charge of issuing deforestation permits have also both signed cooperation agreements with Chortitzer in recent months. Further evidence suggesting new illegal activities inside PNCAT comes from the Totobiegosode people, whose representatives submitted complaints to public prosecutors denouncing fresh illegal invasions and forest clearing by settlers. One of the areas cleared is located close to a lagoon traditionally used by uncontacted Totobiegosode groups. As a consequence, during the earlier part of this year, a group of uncontacted Togobiegosode emerged for the first time, highlighting the importance of action to protect PNCAT. “Julio Duarte, a lawyer representing the Totobiegosode, told Earthsight that in January and February 2021, a band of uncontacted Totobiegosode approached a community of their settled cousins in the southern part of PNCAT at night, and sang to them of their worries about the continued encroachment of outsiders,” Earthsight said. However, the Totobiegosode people have concluded that the government is not serious about protecting their rights or saving the Gran Chaco from destruction, and in protest recently withdrew from a dialogue with the government that was mediated by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR). Meanwhile, Earthsight also disclosed that two of the three Paraguayan leather exporters exposed as having supply chains tainted with hides from cattle grazed inside PNCAT have increased shipments to Italy since the first report was published. This means it’s business as usual for the global leather and car industry, with Paraguayan leather sales to Europe increasing despite companies still being unable to demonstrate how their supply chains are shielded from the problem. According to Earthsight, exports in the first four months of 2021 totaled 9,424 metric tons, increasing by a third from the same period in 2020. Both BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, when contacted by Earthsight, denied that their leather supply chains have any connections to deforestation in Paraguay. While BMW refused to provide further information on the audit commissioned after the publication of the “Grand Theft Chaco” that led to their conclusion, Jaguar Land Rover said that its supplier, Pasubio, the biggest buyer of Paraguayan leather, had assured the company that after extensive investigation, it found it did not breach any national laws. However, Earthsight said the only investigation Pasubio admitted to doing is “obtaining blanket assurance from a Paraguayan ministry that doesn’t have jurisdiction over the relevant laws.” Other automakers said there has been no significant change to their leather sourcing policies. Earthsight said the response of the industry’s voluntary sustainability scheme, the Leather Working Group (LWG), verges on comedic, noting that in February 2021 it inserted a new clause requiring auditors to assess whether tanneries can be sure they aren’t using hides from illegal clearing in the Paraguayan Gran Chaco. Recently, researchers at Humboldt University of Berlin found that the Gran Chaco stores up to 19 times more carbon than previously thought, and called for more international attention to the biome’s conservation. “These recent findings underscore the urgent need for large consumer markets such as the European Union, United Kingdom, and the United States to implement legally binding regulations to curb their ties to forest loss and indigenous rights violations abroad,” Earthsight said.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori) PARIS (AP) — The world’s biggest triceratops skeleton, known as “Big John,” was sold for 6.6 million euros ($7.7 million) Thursday to a private collector at a Paris auction house. The enormous skeleton, estimated to be over 66 million years old, was found in 2014 in South Dakota. The triceratops is known for its three horns on the head. Big John, named after the owner of the land where it was found, is certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest documented skeleton of a triceratops. The dinosaur died in an ancient flood plain on the island continent stretching from present-day Alaska to Mexico, allowing the conservation of its skeleton in mud. The skeleton is 7.15 meters long (23 feet) and stands 2.7 meters high (8 feet) at the hips. The skull represents more than one third of its total length, with two large horns over 1.1 meter long (3.6 feet). The hammer price at the Drouot auction house, before commission and other costs, was 5.5 million euros. “It’s a record for Europe,” auctioneer Alexandre Giquello said. Big John’s skeleton is more than 60% complete and its skull more than 75% complete, making it unique. “The overall quality of Big John really deserved this price,” Iacopo Briano, a paleontology expert, said. “For a triceratops and for an herbivore. This is unbelievable record,” he said. Last year, a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton reached almost $32 million in an auction in New York, becoming the most expensive dinosaur ever sold. Big John was sold to a private U.S. buyer who requested to remain anonymous. Djuan Rivers, a representative for the buyer, said “it’s being acquired by an American collector... absolutely thrilled with the idea of being able to bring a piece like this to his personal use.” “The history behind this and the duration of it is absolutely impressive. So to be able to be a part of preserving something of this nature... it’s also something extremely special,” Rivers added."

But regarding one seemingly radical issue, they are united – lowering the voting age to 16. The Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) have signed up to reduce the age at which Germans can vote from 18 in acknowledgement that an increasingly politicised generation of young people must have a future say in the way the country is run. If their plan goes ahead, Germany would join Austria, the Isle of Man and Guernsey as the only other places in western Europe with such a low voting age. Scotland also allows 16 year olds to vote, though not in UK parliamentary elections. In a handful of German states this has recently been allowed also, but only on a local and regional level. Such a move nationally could also pave the way for other countries to follow the continent’s largest economy. A poll ahead of the German elections last month showed that young people were frustrated at not being able to vote in an election considered gamechanging and that was dominated by the over-50s, who made up the majority – 60% – of voters. Only 14% of voters were under 30, compared with 19% in 1961. The Fridays for Future movement led by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg is credited with contributing to a heightened political awareness among younger people that has had an impact on the mainstream parties of the left in particular. The coronavirus pandemic, with all its social, educational and economic consequences, is also seen to have contributed towards swaying the mood. The Greens and FDP in particular, who secured the most votes among younger people, have stressed the importance of capturing their political enthusiasm. In a widely quoted poll carried out by the environmental NGO Nabu, 59% of voters over 65 said before the 26 September vote they would not be considering younger voters’ climate protection interests when they cast their ballots. In a subsequent mock election of more than 200,000 young people across Germany held just over a week before the real election, 21% of participants voted for the Greens, which was interpreted as an indication the party might have received considerably more than the 15% it secured in the official election had the voting age been lower. The last time an adjustment to Germany’s voting age was made was 50 years ago when it was reduced from 21 to 18. But even though the policy already appears in black and white on page 10 of the provisional agreement drawn up by the parties set to form the “traffic light” coalition – so-called due to the parties’ colours – in which it is described as “belonging to the realisation of a modern democracy”, it still faces a series of tough hurdles. The voting age is established in article 38, paragraph 16 of the German constitution. Any attempt to change it requires a change in the constitution, for which a three-quarter majority in parliament is necessary. The prospective ruling coalition would have to secure support from other parliamentary factions for this to happen. While it can rely on votes from the leftwing Die Linke, this would not be sufficient. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is completely opposed to the idea and the conservative CDU/CSU alliance is largely against it. Even as recently as May, when the Greens and FDP proposed a law change on the issue, the SPD voted against it in what was seen as an effort to keep its increasingly fractious partnership with the conservatives intact. Thorsten Frei, the deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary group, said this week he was “very sceptical” about lowering the age and did not think conservative parliamentarians could be won over. “Without a doubt, there are many young people with a strong political interest,” he told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung. “But rights and obligations have to be in alignment, and the question is whether it makes sense, on the one hand, to be able to partake in decision-making about the future of our country, but on the other, to not be able to sign a mobile phone contract or watch certain films at the cinema without parental consent? I have my doubts.” However, amid dwindling support, the party may also be forced to change course. In the 1960s, the last time the issue was strongly debated and given voice in student protest, military service played a big role in the debate. It was argued that if young people were expected to defend their country, they could not be denied to right to vote, paving the way for a law change in the early 70s. Even if the incoming government is not immediately successful in its plans, political analysts and observers are convinced it will be only a matter of time before public opinion leads to a change for which the Greens, SPD and FDP would look to take credit. Michael Weigl, a political scientist at the University of Passau, recently told Bavarian Broadcasting: “Many young people don’t have the feeling that politics is decided with their interests in mind. And that in and of itself is of course already a sign that something has to change. “I believe we will have a voting age of 16 before long.”"

It was apparently the work of a group of mysterious rescuers who left a spray-painted banner reading, ""The dogs are fine."" The message was signed ""A Team."" The dogs' plight has made headlines for weeks after emergency teams realized the animals had been stranded by lava from a volcano's prolonged eruption on the island of La Palma, Spain. Drones have dropped food and water for the animals as officials considered ways to rescue them. It was deemed too risky to attempt by foot; helicopters were ruled out due to ash and pyroclastic rocks in the air. Animal advocacy group Leales then asked the drone company Aerocamaras to use large cargo drones to fetch the dogs, trapping them in nets and flying them to safety. That plan moved ahead this week as special flight permits were approved. But then the animal rescue story turned into a dog-gone mystery. ""This morning we have made reconnaissance flights of the area where the dogs were, but at the moment we have not obtained any trace,"" drone company Aerocamaras said Wednesday via Twitter. Leales said Thursday that ""anonymous animalists"" seem to have entered the area and rescued the dogs, citing a video it had received by email as well as footprints that were detected by Aerocamaras' drones. The animal group posted a video to YouTube showing a banner on a wall where one of the dogs was located. The footage opens with the famous opening lines of the 1980s TV show The A Team, describing (in Spanish, in this case) a band of commandos who became soldiers of fortune after being accused of a crime they didn't commit. Footage in the anonymous video was shot by a drone. Leales said it suspects that the unknown rescuers might have used a drone's thermal imaging to determine a relatively ""cold"" path through the lava field. Leales said the video arrived via a brief email that was also signed by the A Team. The message thanked the group for its work and concluded with the hashtag many locals in La Palma have embraced: #masfuertesqueelvolcan — stronger than the volcano. Aerocamaras said that its drone flights Wednesday had shown the banner where one of the dogs had been, but because the wind had seemingly flipped the large sheet over, the message wasn't visible at first sight. While it seems that the dogs have been carried to safety, Leales said it would like to know who the rescuers are and for them to share proof that the dogs — some of which had been emaciated by their ordeal — are in good condition.

The eruption – which began on 19 September on the Cumbre Vieja ridge, one of the most active volcanic regions in the archipelago – has destroyed more than 2,000 properties, forced the evacuation of more than 7,500 people, and devastated La Palma’s banana plantations. It had also left some dogs in the town of Todoque stranded by lava flows. A team of specialists from the Aerocamaras drone company arrived on the island last week and began preparing an unprecedented search and rescue operation whereby drones would be used to drop food and then, once the dogs had got used to the presence of the unmanned craft, airlift them to safety. But the first drone search on Wednesday, which included two thermal cameras, revealed no sign of the animals. It did, however, turn up some human footprints. On Thursday a video appeared online that seemed to suggest any further drone deployments would be in vain. It showed a banner – placed in the water container where the dogs were last seen – which read: “Stay strong La Palma! The dogs are fine.” The video that appeared online. The banner was signed the A-Team, and decorated with red splodges that were presumably intended as a homage to the bullet holes that featured in the opening credits of the 1980s TV show. The video also featured photos of a number of dogs. “We’ve seen the video and we’ve confirmed it’s real, like the footprints we found yesterday,” Jaime Pereira, the chief executive of Aerocamaras, told reporters on the island on Thursday. “The main thing is that, one way or another, the dogs have got out.” Pereira said his teams had seen the banner featured in the video but had been unable to read it from the air as it had flipped over in the wind. He also said the rescue could have taken place days ago. “We realised that something odd was going on because we’d checked all the areas where they could have been but didn’t find anything,” he said. “All we want to do now is see the dogs, check that they’re OK – and make sure that they’re really the ones we’ve been looking for.” The members of the A-Team may have opted for anonymity to avoid any possible punishment for venturing into the exclusion zone to rescue the dogs. A source from the local media outlet that published the video, Palmerus.es, told the Spanish daily El País the animals were fine. For the time being, the source added, it would be difficult to explain exactly what had happened given “it was illegal” to set foot in the exclusion zone.

REUTERS/Stringer Summary Government: Raid targeted military training centre TPLF says plane hit no targets ADDIS ABABA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Ethiopia carried out an air strike on the city of Mekelle for the third day this week, a government spokesperson said, in a campaign to weaken rebellious Tigrayan forces they have been fighting for nearly a year. Spokesperson Legesse Tulu told Reuters the strike hit a military training centre being used by the Tigrayan forces. He said the centre was a former base, known as the Northern Command, for the Ethiopian military in the area. War broke out in November 2020 between federal troops and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for three decades but now controls just the northern region. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 2 million have been forced to flee. The air strikes come amid intensified fighting in the neighbouring northern region of Amhara, where the government launched a ground offensive last week and is trying to recover territory it lost to the TPLF several months ago. TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda told Reuters that a fighter jet had been over the city of Mekelle on Thursday afternoon and had made several sorties, but to his knowledge the plane had not hit any targets. Reuters was unable to independently confirm either the government statement or that from the TPLF. EXPLOSION A resident of Mekelle told Reuters he had heard what he believed to be the sound of a fighter jet flying overhead at 3:24 p.m., and heard the sound of an explosion which he took to be from an anti-aircraft gun. The raids come as the Tigrayan forces claim they are advancing quickly despite the military's attempts to beat them back. Tigrayan forces are close to the large towns of Dessie and Kombulcha, but are securing the countryside to the north by pushing out federal troops and allied militias, Getachew said. Asked about that claim, the government spokesperson referred Reuters to a statement earlier in which it said that people, especially youth, from parts of Amhara and neighbouring Afar regions are mobilizing to defend their land from the Tigrayan fighters. It called on people from other parts of Ethiopia to support the effort, saying that an ""organised mobilisation"" was needed to defeat the Tigrayan forces. Kombulcha has an airport and a number of factories, while Dessie is now home to many tens of thousands who fled fighting further to the north. Kombulcha is located on one of two major highways that link the capital of landlocked Ethiopia to the seaport in neighbouring Djibouti.

REUTERS/George Frey WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The carbon-intensive production of plastics is on pace to emit more greenhouse gases than coal-fired power plants within this decade, undercutting global efforts to tackle climate change, a report released on Thursday said. The report by Bennington College and Beyond Plastics projected that the plastic industry releases at least 232 million tons of greenhouse gases each year throughout its lifecycle from the drilling for oil and gas to fuel its facilities to incineration of plastic waste. That is the equivalent of 116 coal-fired power plants. “The scale of the plastics industry’s greenhouse gas emissions is staggering, but it’s equally concerning that few people in government or in the business community are even talking about it,"" said Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and president of Beyond Plastics. Also, the report found that petrochemical facilities tend to be clustered in just 18 largely low-income and minority communities, where 90% of the pollution occurs. With at least a dozen more plastic production plants under construction and 15 more planned, resulting emissions would undercut any gains made by phasing out coal power and shifting toward more renewable energy, Enck said. The report also said authorities probably have undercounted emissions and air pollution related to different stages of the production of plastics and export of plastic waste. That is because U.S. regulations do not require the plastic industry to report them and no federal agency tracks them, said report author Jim Vallette of research group Material Research. Plastics Industry Association spokesman George O'Connor said in a statement that the report ""cherry picks data"" and pointed to other studies that found that plastic actually results in lower carbon emissions due to its lighter weight and durability compared to alternatives like glass and paper. Enck said the report is based on data from federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and Commerce Department, which are based on plastic industry reporting. She conceded that plastic was lightweight and durable but added that the industry's calculations neglect other factors that increase emissions.

Putin told a group of journalists and Russia experts that Tuesday's visit to Ukraine by Lloyd Austin, in which he said no third country had the right to veto its hoped-for NATO membership, had effectively paved the way for Kyiv to join. Whether it did or not, Putin said, Russia's interests were targeted.

They bombarded the facilities in Saawan neighborhood on Thursday, Yemen’s Arabic-language al-Masirah television network reported, citing local sources. Saudi military spokesman Turki al-Maliki confirmed the airstrikes, alleging that the kingdom had exercised restraint in recent months in support of UN efforts and initiatives to find a comprehensive and lasting political solution to the Yemen crisis. The spokesman for Yemen’s Ansarullah resistance movement, Mohammed Abdul-Salam, denounced the aggression. “The bombardment of pharmaceutical warehouses and other civilian facilities in Sana’a come in light of the recent statement by the UN Security Council, which is completely biased in favor of the coalition of aggression. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia is forging ahead with its aggression and siege instead of stopping them and calculating the upshot of its foolishness,” he wrote in a post published on his Twitter page. The Ministry of Public Health and Population of the Yemeni Salvation Government also condemned in a statement the Saudi airstrikes, stating that the raids resulted in severe damage to pharmaceutical warehouses, and complete destruction of all medicines and medical supplies inside them. It described the strikes as a “criminal act,” emphasizing that they were carried out at a time when the Saudi-led coalition of aggression is preventing the entry of basic commodities, especially medications and medical supplies, into Yemen. The statement said the alliance is intent on killing Yemeni people by paralyzing the health sector in the country, noting that the Saudi-led war coalition’s continued siege and bans on the entry of medicines and medical supplies have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The Yemeni Health Ministry went on to say that the bombardment of residential neighborhoods and critical infrastructure exposes the Saudi-led war alliance’s utter disregard for civilian lives amid the continued silence of the United Nations. The ministry held the UN morally and legally responsible for the slaughter of Yemeni people and demolition of civilian infrastructure, stressing that its silence and inaction has emboldened the Riyadh regime and its allies. Ansarullah: UN resolutions have no positive effect Also on Thursday, Abdul-Salam dismissed the UN Security Council’s call for a halt to fighting in the country’s oil-rich Ma’rib province, saying the council blindly supports the Saudi-led war coalition, regularly assumes stances in favor of the kingdom, and its resolutions have had no positive effect. “We emphasize that Yemen is in a defensive position, and will continue to counter aggression through all available means of defense,” Ansarullah's spokesman stated. تبني مجلس الأمن موقف قوى العدوان ليس بجديد،وهو بانحيازه الفج والأعمى منذ أول يوم ساهم في إطالة هذا الصراع كل هذه السنوات،كما أنه بنفسه يعطل بياناته من أي تأثير إيجابي، ومن جهتنا نؤكد أن اليمن ومن موقع الدفاع عن النفس مستمر في صد العدوان وبكل وسيلة دفاعية ممكنة. — محمد عبدالسلام (@abdusalamsalah) October 21, 2021 “Foreign intervention is a major obstacle to the Yemeni-Yemeni political solution. I believe international apathy towards Yemen's crisis is one of the most important reasons for the prolongation of the war,” Hossein al-Ezi, deputy foreign minister of the Yemeni Salvation Government, wrote in a post on his Twitter page. “I rule out the possibility for a Yemeni-Yemeni political solution unless outsiders are pushed out,"" he added. The UN Security Council called on Wednesday for “de-escalation” in Yemen and warned against “the growing risk of large-scale famine” in the conflict-ridden Arab country. The 15-member council “stressed the need for de-escalation by all sides,” and demanded an immediate nationwide ceasefire. They also called for an end to military operations by Yemeni armed forces and Popular Committees fighters against Saudi mercenaries in Ma’rib. “The members of the Security Council expressed grave concern for the dire humanitarian situation, including prolonged starvation and the growing risk of large-scale famine,” the text said. The UN body also repeated its concern over “the grave threat posed by the Safer oil tanker.” The Safer tanker reportedly allows vessels to anchor offshore and transfer oil extracted and processed from installations in the Ma'arib oil field in central Yemen. The tanker is said to contain 34 crude oil tanks of different sizes and volumes, amounting to a total capacity of around 3 million barrels. The ship has been moored several kilometers outside the Red Sea port of Ras Isa, north of Hudaydah. Missile attack on Saudi troops in Jizan On Thursday, Yemeni army forces and allied fighters from Popular Committees launched a missile strike against Saudi troops in the kingdom’s southwestern border region of Jizan, killing and wounding dozens of them in the process. Spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces Brigadier General Yahya Saree said five homegrown ballistic missiles were fired on Wednesday evening at a major position of Saudi military forces, which houses command headquarters, arms depots and hangars for Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. تمكنت القوة الصاروخية بفضل الله من تنفيذ عملية نوعية استهدفت معسكر قوات الواجب بجيزان يوم أمس الأربعاء بخمسة صواريخ باليستية استهدفت مقر القيادة ومخازن الأسلحة ومرابض طائرات الأباتشي وكانت الإصابات دقيقة. — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) October 21, 2021 He added that the missiles precisely hit the designated targets, which resulted in the killing and injury of more than 35 Saudi forces, including senior officers and pilots. Earlier, Saudi social media activists said the missiles struck a Saudi military base in Abu ‘Arish city, adding that six officers as well as 12 conscripts were killed as a result. They added that at least 20 Saudi soldiers sustained injuries in the attack as well. Saudi Arabia, backed by the US and regional allies, launched the war on Yemen in March 2015, with the goal of bringing the government of Hadi back to power and crushing Ansarullah. The war has left hundreds of thousands of Yemenis dead, and displaced millions more. It has also destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and spread famine and infectious diseases. Yemeni armed forces and the Popular Committees have grown steadily in strength against the Saudi-led invaders, and left Riyadh and its allies bogged down in the country."

Days before Cop26, the international climate change negotiations taking place in Glasgow, the leaks show fossil fuel producers including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Japan are lobbying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to remove recommendations that the world needs to phase out fossil fuels. According to the documents, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), whose members include Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, also backed weakening the report’s recommendations on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, large meat and dairy producers such as Brazil and Argentina reportedly attempted to change messages about the climate benefits of promoting plant-based diets, according to the leak of more than 32,000 comments by governments, corporations, academics and others on the draft report of the IPCC’s working group III, which looks at measures to protect the globe from rising temperatures. Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, told Unearthed: “These comments show the tactics some countries are willing to adopt to obstruct and delay action to cut emissions. On the eve of the crucial Cop26 talks there is, to me, a clear public interest in knowing what these governments are saying behind the scenes. “Like most scientists I’m uncomfortable with leaks of draft reports, as in an ideal world the scientists writing these reports should be able to do their job in peace. But we don’t live in an ideal world, and with emissions still increasing, the stakes couldn’t be higher.” The IPCC said its processes were designed to guard against lobbying and that in order to do this it used “diverse and balanced author teams, a review process open to all, and decision-making on texts by consensus”. Prof Martin Siegert, a co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said the report exposed the behaviour of certain countries that have attempted to hold back progress on decarbonisation. “This lobbying has no impact on the scientific credibility of the IPCC report, however. That the IPCC upholds the science in the face of such forceful vested interests is a triumph, and we should be grateful to the scientists involved for not yielding to such pressure,” he said. “Be under no illusion, decarbonisation at the level we need to avoid dangerous climate change will be opposed by some, perhaps many, in the fossil fuel industry and by a number of people, companies and nations that benefit financially from fossil fuels.” Mark Maslin, a professor of earth system science at University College London, said: “Countries have always been encouraged to comment on all the IPCC climate change reports. Many countries take this as an opportunity to lobby the scientists to change their conclusions – for example Australia wanting to support coal, Saudi Arabia wanting to support oil, Russia natural gas and Brazil beef production. “But it has no effect on the reports. Scientists, social scientists and economists that work on these reports are led by the evidence and what is best for the world and all of its peoples. This is why the public and politicians all around the world trust scientists and the IPCC reports as they know they will not be influenced by petty politics. Q&A What is the IPCC? Show The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, it was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to determine the state of knowledge on climate change. For each report, the IPCC assembles hundreds of senior scientists from across the world to assess the current state of knowledge. It publishes major 'assessment' reports every 5–7 years, with the next, 'AR6' due in 2022, as well as producing ad hoc special reports. The IPCC has more than 190 member countries, and its reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages to guarantee their quality, with member governments signing off the final versions. The ""Principles Governing IPCC Work"" states it will assess: the risk of human-induced climate change potential impacts possible options for prevention In October 2018 it published a special report analysing current climate research stating that we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, and that urgent changes are needed to cut risk of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. “The lobbying also drives home what we need to do to reduce climate change: stop using coal as soon as possible, phase out oil and natural gas usage as soon as possible, stop deforestation and start reforestation and move to a more plant-based diet and definitely cut down the amount of beef we produce. Not only will this reduce our carbon emissions but it will save millions of lives due to massively improved air quality and diet.” At Cop26, which begins at the end of the month, representatives from most countries will gather to try to agree on measures to tackle the climate crisis. Delegates are being asked to do their bit to uphold a global heating target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid the most serious and irreversible damage to the planet."

But the Syrian regime has pocketed $100M by making the UN use its internal exchange rate, an analysis found. Syria is cash-strapped and subject to strict sanctions from the EU, US, and UK. 10 Things in Politics: The latest in politics & the economy Loading Something is loading. Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy The Syrian government has diverted $100 million worth of UN aid donations by manipulating the value of its currency, according to a new analysis. President Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime has been subject to harsh sanctions for years, meaning the government can't generate revenue through trade with the likes of the US, UK, and EU. Millions of dollars in Syrian government assets have been frozen in banks located in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. As a result, the Syrian central bank has turned to illicit means to generate capital, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said as part of a study conducted with the Operations & Policy Center and the Center for Operational Analysis and Research. The UN funnels millions in aid to Syria each year for poverty relief, but according to an analysis of 779 public UN contracts, Syria has since 2019 made the UN use the central bank's official exchange rate of between 2,500 and 1,500 Syrian pounds to one US dollar, CSIS said. The unofficial — and less lucrative — rate, used by traders and on the black market, is 3,500 Syrian pounds to the dollar. This means that 50% of foreign aid sent to Syria by the UN in 2020 was lost to the government, the researchers said. According to the report, the Syrian government has made a total of $100 million from this scheme since 2019. The bodies targeted by the Syrian regime included the UN's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the World Food Programme, the UN Development Programme, and UNICEF, according to to the Guardian. The UN did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. ""This shows an incredibly systematic way of diverting aid before it even has a chance to be implemented or used on the ground,"" said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow at CSIS, according to The Guardian. ""If the goal of sanctions overall is to deprive the regime of the resources to commit acts of violence against civilians and the goal of humanitarian aid is to reach people in need then we have this instance … where aid is at complete contradiction to those two stated goals."""

Pages owned by the World Doctors Alliance – a group of current and former medical professionals and academics from seven countries – received 617,000 interactions in June 2021, up from 255,000 in January, according to a six-month rolling average. The figures are revealed in a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which raises fresh questions for Facebook after the whistleblower Frances Haugen claimed that the company knew its products were damaging the mental health of teenage girls and fanning the flames of ethnic violence in Ethiopia. The World Doctors Alliance includes prominent members who have falsely claimed Covid-19 is a hoax and that vaccines cause widespread harm. Researchers found members “used their qualifications to lend a veneer of credibility to claims that have been proven to be false and often dangerous”. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: “Facebook’s attempts to control the epidemic of misleading information on its platforms are nothing more than performative PR exercises. “It has had more than a decade to get a handle on the rampant misinformation which has flooded its platforms. But the systems in place fall a long way short of the mark, as this research clearly demonstrates. “With each new revelation of Facebook’s institutional failure to act, we move closer to social media’s so-called ‘big tobacco moment’, when it is forced to finally take responsibility for the demonstrable harms caused by their products.” In March 2020, the World Doctors Alliance had a combined following on Facebook of about 4,000 users. This had increased to more than 460,000 by June this year. The increase was mostly driven by the two most prominent members of the group: Dr Dolores Cahill, a former professor at University College Dublin, and Dr Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Minnesota. Jensen drew international attention after he said extra payments for Covid patients created an incentive for doctors to inflate patient numbers, despite no evidence of fraudulent reporting, according to a USA Today factcheck. Donald Trump then amplified this claim on the campaign trail in 2020. Cahill, who until March was the chairperson of the rightwing Eurosceptic Irish Freedom party, has claimed Covid-19 vaccines will cause widespread harm and death. Cahill has also claimed that masks and social distancing measures are unnecessary because Covid-19 can be treated with “nutrition, vitamins and hydroxychloroquine”. British members of the group include Dr Mohammad Adil, an NHS surgeon who was suspended by the General Medical Council after claiming Covid-19 was a hoax. Researchers took a sample of the 50 most popular posts from Alliance members, and categorised them into different narratives. They found the most popular claims were “conspiratorial in nature, implying some sort of overarching ‘master plan’ involving world governments, the media and healthcare authorities”. The ISD also found serious shortcomings in Facebook’s factchecking programme, particularly regarding content in languages other than English. One part of the company’s strategy for dealing with misinformation involves using third-party organisations to add context to misleading claims. However, a review of the 50 most popular mentioning the World Doctors Alliance revealed that just 13% of English-language posts containing false or misleading content carried a factcheck label. In languages other than English, the proportion was even lower: 8% of German posts, 5% of Spanish posts and just 2% of Arabic posts. Aoife Gallagher, a researcher at the ISD, said: “The approach to factchecking content one post at a time essentially acts as a plaster on a gushing wound. Many of the influencers in the Covid and vaccine misinformation spaces produce huge amounts of content, making it impossible for factcheckers to keep up with debunking efforts.” The ISD called on Facebook to take stronger action on “misinformation super-spreaders”, increase resources dedicated to moderation and factchecking in languages other than English, and improve AI technology to assist with moderation. A spokesperson for Facebook said it had removed the parent group for the World Doctors’ Alliance, World Freedom Alliance, in July, as well as removing 200m pieces of misinformation during the pandemic. The spokesperson said: “Since the pandemic began, our goal has been to promote reliable information about Covid-19, take more aggressive action against misinformation, and encourage people to get vaccinated.” The World Doctors Alliance did not respond to a request for comment."

This was despite repeated government warnings that the rally was illegal and violated Covid-19 restrictions. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) said some 80,000 members joined rallies across 13 cities, which caused severe traffic congestion and disruption. A one-day strike involving 550,000 members also took place across the country, it added. Many schools were affected as canteen workers hung up their aprons. About 1,000 delivery workers also turned off their phone apps to join the strike. Irregular workers do not receive the full benefits under South Korea's labour laws. They include temporary workers and contract workers. In Seoul, 27,000 people took to the streets. The police deployed about 12,000 officers to set up ""bus walls"" and fences to prevent people from gathering at Gwanghwamun Plaza, where most rallies take place. Nearby subway exits were also blocked off. This forced the union members, many clad in pink and white, to march towards Seodaemun Station instead. They were seen waving flags and chanting for better labour rights. Local reports said some of them clashed with police officers who were trying to block them from moving. The police and the Seoul city government have both issued repeated warnings that such a large-scale gathering goes against the Infectious Disease Prevention Act. All rallies are banned under the Level 4 social distancing measures in Seoul and greater Seoul. President Moon Jae-in also urged the KCTU to refrain from rallying, saying that it could make it harder for health authorities to slow the spread of Covid-19. The country reported 1,571 new cases on Wednesday, the 12th consecutive day that numbers have remained below 2,000. This brings the total tally to 346,088. However, the union decided to push ahead with the aim of highlighting labour issues ahead of the presidential election next March. It also promised to comply with antivirus guidelines and complete the strike and rally peacefully. An estimated 2,500 union members gathered in front of Gwangju city hall, while 2,800 rallied in front of Changwon city hall. Another 1,000 people gathered in the city centre of Chuncheon city. The police said they will pursue legal action against the organisers. The KCTU has about 1.1 million members and is one of two major labour unions in the country. It said last week that it had constantly urged the government to address issues faced by irregular workers who suffered the most due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ""but the government tried to muzzle us without giving an answer"". As at August last year, irregular workers accounted for 36.1 per cent of the total number of salaried workers."

Pfizer has 73 formalized deals for its COVID-19 vaccine but of those, only five have been formally published by governments and include 'significant redactions,' Public Citizen found. The seven known contracts reviewed by Public Citizen are worth more than $5 billion. The advocacy group - which gained access to several leaked, unredacted contracts - claims the Manhattan-based pharmaceutical giant's contracts 'consistently place Pfizer's interests before public health imperatives.' The report accuses Pfizer of including secret language blocking donations of its own doses, opposing an intellectual property waiver that could have allowed for the sharing of technology, having 'unilateral authority for other decisions' and more. Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine - the first to receive emergency use authorization in the U.S. - has become the most popular worldwide, with 3.5 billion doses purchased. Pfizer has 73 formalized deals for its COVID-19 vaccine but of those contracts, only five have been formally published by governments and are heavily redacted. The known contracts are worth $5 billion and were reviewed by Public Citizen, which outlined its findings (pictured) Experts predict its sales to double in 2022, the Washington Post reported. Due to the fact that information in several contracts remains redacted, it is unknown exactly what the total cost of all agreements are. The details and obligations outlined in numerous contracts also remain undisclosed. Experts allege that secret contracts poises risks to others. 'Hiding contracts from public view or publishing documents filled with redacted text means we don't know how or when vaccines will arrive, what happens if things go wrong and the level of financial risk buyers are absorbing,' Tom Wright, research manager at the Transparency International Health Program, said. Public Citizen gained access to Pfizer's contracts with the US, UK, Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Dominican Republic, European Commission and Peru. 'The contracts offer a rare glimpse into the power one pharmaceutical corporation has gained to silence governments, throttle supply, shift risk and maximize profits in the worst public health crisis in a century,' the group's report alleges. Contract experts, who reportedly analyzed the leaked documents, claim that Pfizer uses 'unfair and abusive' contractual terms in negotiations that give them the right to silence governments. Public Citizen - who gained access to several leaked, unredacted Pfizer contracts - claims the Manhattan-based pharmaceutical giant's contracts 'consistently place Pfizer's interests before public health imperatives' The report accuses Pfizer of including secret language blocking donations of Pfizer doses (pictured), opposing an intellectual property waiver that could have allowed for the sharing of technology, having 'unilateral authority for other decisions' and more Certain contracts, including one between Pfizer and Brazil, prohibits the government from making 'any public announcement concerning the existence, subject matter or terms of [the] Agreement' or commenting on its relationship with Pfizer without written consent from the company. Similar terminology is found in the US and European contracts, however the terms apply to both parties. 'This is next-level stuff,' Tahir Amin, an intellectual property lawyer who co-founded nonprofit global health organization I-Mak, said. Sharon Castillo, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, told the newspaper that 'confidentiality clauses were 'standard in commercial contracts' and 'intended to help build trust between the parties, as well as protect the confidential commercial information exchanged during negotiations and included in final contracts.' The group also accuses Pfizer of controlling supply of their vaccine. Public Citizen claims the Brazilian government is restricted from accepting Pfizer vaccine donations from other countries or buying vaccines from others without Pfizer's permission. The country is also restricted from donating, distributing, exporting or otherwise transporting the vaccine outside Brazil without Pfizer's consent. In at least four contracts, Pfizer has the right to use anyone's intellectual property with consequence, according to the report. These countries are also required to cover legal expenses if another vaccine maker sued Pfizer for patent infringement in their country. Pfizer (World Headquarters in Manhattan pictured) has rejected the allegations made in Public Citizen's report Additionally, the company requires that all disputes be decided through private arbitration, not public courts. The existence of arbitration, arbitral proceedings, submissions made by all involved parties and decisions made during the process are expected to remain private. Several contracts state that the government involved 'expressly and irrevocably waives immunity which either it or its assets may have or acquire in the future'. This includes 'immunity against precautionary seizure of any of its assets.' 'It's almost as if the company would ask the United States to put the Grand Canyon as collateral,' said Lawrence Gostin, Georgetown University professor of public health law, commenting to the Washington Post on the 'extreme' clause. However, Pfizer rejected the claim, saying: 'Pfizer has not interfered and has absolutely no intention of interfering with any country's diplomatic, military, or culturally significant assets. To suggest anything to the contrary is irresponsible and misleading.' Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine - the first to receive emergency use authorization in the US - has become the most popular worldwide, with 3.5 billion doses purchased. Experts predict sales to double in 2022 Lastly, Public Citizen argues that Pfizer maintains the right to make all key decisions. They claim the company requires governments to give them 'sole discretion' when it comes to vaccine decisions. 'What happens if there are vaccine supply shortages?,' the report reads. 'In the Albania draft contract and the Brazil and Colombia agreement, Pfizer will decide adjustments to the delivery schedule based on principles the corporation will decide. Albania, Brazil, and Colombia 'shall be deemed to agree to any revision.' Public Citizen has called on the US government to 'use its leverage' to force Pfizer into taking different contractual approaches. 'The global community cannot allow pharmaceutical corporations to keep calling the shots,' Zain Rizvi, the researcher who wrote the report, told the Washington Post. 'The Biden administration can step up and balance the scales.' Pfizer did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment."

Australia was the worst climate performer among comparable developed countries since the 2015 Paris Agreement imposed binding commitments to limit global warming, a think tank reported on Thursday Oct. 21, 2021, ahead of an important conference in Scotland later this month. (AP Photo/Rob Griffith, File) CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia was the worst climate performer among comparable developed countries since nations pledged in the 2015 Paris agreement to take action to limit global warming, a think tank said Thursday ahead of a key climate conference in Scotland later this month. The U.N. summit in Glasgow, known as COP26, will bring together thousands of diplomats, scientists and environmental campaigners to assess progress since nations agreed in the Paris accord to limit warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The meeting in Glasgow is widely seen as the last chance to hold global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Prime Minister Scott Morrison plans to attend the conference starting Oct. 31, but lawmakers in his governing coalition are arguing over adoption of a tougher national carbon reduction target. Morrison wants to commit Australia to reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, but some lawmakers in the conservative government’s junior coalition partner, the Nationals party, are resisting. ADVERTISEMENT “Australia ranks dead last among comparable nations (in) addressing the climate challenge at its source — by cutting emissions,” the report from the Climate Council said. The council is an independently funded non-profit that replaced the Climate Commission, a publicly funded agency abolished in 2013 by the newly elected conservative government in which Morrison was a Cabinet minister. The report ranked Australia last among 31 wealthy, developed countries on the criteria of emissions reduction performances and pledges. Britain was first, followed by Switzerland and Sweden. The United States was 23rd. Australia was tied for last with Canada in terms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Next from the bottom was Norway, then the United States. The Czech Republic came first with Sweden and Switzerland sharing second place. Major emitters including China, India and Russia were not included in the tables. Morrison is unlikely to persuade his colleagues to agree to a more ambitious 2030 target before he goes to Glasgow. Australia has not budged from its 2015 pledge in Paris to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, despite many countries adopting far more ambitious targets. The Climate Council recommended Australia reduce emissions by 75% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2035. Australian emissions from electricity have increased by a third since 1990, while transport emissions have grown by more than half, the report said. If Australia achieves its current 2030 targets, the progress will mostly be reached through reduced land clearing and other land use changes, Climate Council Head of Research Simon Bradshaw told The Associated Press. “Now that, of course, is important, but it’s no substitute for actually stopping emissions at their source,” Bradshaw said. Reducing emissions is a politically fraught issue in Australia, which is one of the world’s largest exporters of coal and liquified natural gas. The nation is also one of the world’s worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its heavy reliance on coal-fired power."

At the request of legislators, the court agreed to extend its deadline for Congress to formally end prohibition on multiple occasions. But because of the repeated failed attempts to meet those deadlines, justices ultimately voted to end criminalization on their own in June. “In these times, there is no longer room for the prohibitionist policy,” Senate President Olga Sánchez Cordero, who previously served at a cabinet-level position in President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administration, said at an event marking the opening of a new Senate-hosted exhibit on cannabis on Tuesday. 🔴 Inauguración de la exposición “Cannabis, más allá de lo lúdico”, del 19 de octubre de 2021. https://t.co/qbdj8yfNQt — Senado de México (@senadomexicano) October 19, 2021 “We are the Mexico of freedoms, and the people are aware of it,” she said, according to a translation. Lawmakers will take up implementation legislation “in the coming weeks or months—but I do not want more time to pass,” she said. “The policy that we want to build in the Senate of the Republic is aimed at eliminating prohibitionism and guaranteeing the safety and control of consumption based on proper regulation,” the senator said. Sen. Martha Lucía Micher Camarena, a leader in the ruling MORENA party, said that their “commitment is with Mexicans—it is with native communities, it is with people’s health, with recreation.” Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal Avila also said recently that the stage is set for lawmakers to actually pass a marijuana legalization bill during the new session after multiple attempts in recent years fell short of getting over the finish line. “With the beginning of the LXV Legislature, a new possibility was opened to discuss and approve this long-delayed law, which would put an end to 100 years of prohibitionist policy and criminalization of the consumption of the cannabis flower, opening, in turn, a multimillion dollar market nationally and internationally, which could be beneficial for the economic reactivation of our country,” he said earlier this month. After the Supreme Court independently invalidated prohibition earlier this year, advocates stressed that the decision underscores the need for legislators to expeditiously pass a measure to implement a comprehensive system of legal and regulated sales. They want to ensure that a market is established that’s equitable, addresses the harms of criminalization on certain communities and promotes personal freedom. Lawmakers came close to achieving that goal over the past three years—but failed to get the job done. The Senate approved a legalization bill late last year, and then the Chamber of Deputies made revisions and passed it in March, sending it back to the originating chamber. A couple of Senate committees then took up and cleared the amended measure, but leaders quickly started signaling that certain revisions made the proposal unworkable. Monreal said further revisions may be necessary to get a final bill ready for enactment. “If this law is approved in this ordinary period of session, some modifications should also be made to the tax collection legal framework, to provide for a special tax on cannabis and its derivatives, as is the case of other products with an impact on public health: spirits, beer, gasoline and tobacco,” he said, estimating that it could result in the equivalent of nearly a billion U.S. dollars in revenue. After the Chamber of Deputies previously approved the Senate-passed legalization bill, senators said that the revised proposal was critically internally conflicted—on provisions concerning legal possession limits, the definition of hemp and other issues—and lawmakers themselves could be subject to criminal liability if it went into effect as drafted. But Monreal said in April that if the court were to make a declaration of unconstitutionality before a measure to regulate cannabis was approved, it would result in “chaos.” The top senator also talked about the importance of lawmakers taking their time to craft good policy and not rush amidst lobbying from tobacco and pharmaceutical industry interests. “We must not allow ourselves to be pressured by interests,” he said at the time. “The Senate must act with great prudence in this matter.” Sen. Eduardo Ramírez Aguilar of the MORENA party said in April that “at this time, it is important to legislate in the terms that are presented to us” and then consider additional revisions to cannabis laws through subsequent bills. That’s the position many legalization advocates took as well, urging lawmakers to pass an imperfect bill immediately and then work on fixing it later. Under the proposal, adults 18 and older would be allowed to purchase and possess up to 28 grams of marijuana and cultivate up to six plants for personal use. The deputies made changes that principally concern the regulatory structure, rules for the commercial market and licensing policies. One of the most notable changes made by the Chamber of Deputies was that the revised bill would not establish a new independent regulatory body to oversee the licensing and implementation of the program as was approved by the Senate. Instead, it would give that authority to an existing agency, the National Commission Against Addictions. Deputies also approved additional revisions to increase penalties for unauthorized possession of large amounts of cannabis, prevent forest land from being converted to marijuana growing areas and to require regulators to “coordinate campaigns against problematic cannabis use and…develop permanent actions to deter and prevent its use by minors and vulnerable groups.” Advocates had hoped for more. Throughout this legislative process, they’ve called for changes to further promote social equity and eliminate strict penalties for violating the law. While the bill would give priority for licenses to marginalized communities, advocates are worried that there might not be strict and specific enough criteria to actually ensure that ends up being the case. They also pushed for an amendment to make it so a specific percentage of licenses would be set aside for those communities, but that did not happen. Monreal, for his part, said ahead of the Chamber of Deputies vote that there “is no problem if they modify the cannabis law, we have no problem.” “That is their job and their function. And on the return we will review whether or not they are appropriate,” he said, according to a translation. “The idea is to regulate the use of cannabis and not ignore a prohibitionist approach that generated a great social problem in the country.” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in December that a vote on legalization legislation was delayed due to minor “mistakes” in the proposal. The legalization bill cleared a joint group of Senate committees prior to the full floor vote in that chamber last year, with some amendments being made after members informally considered and debated the proposal during a virtual hearing. Members of the Senate’s Justice, Health, and Legislative Studies Committees had approved a prior version of legal cannabis legislation last year as well, but the pandemic delayed consideration of the issue. Sen. Julio Ramón Menchaca Salazar of the MORENA party said in April that legalizing cannabis could fill treasury coffers at a time when the economy is recovering from the health crisis. As lawmakers work to advance the reform legislation, there’s been a more lighthearted push to focus attention on the issue by certain members and activists. That push has mostly involved planting and gifting marijuana. Late last year, Sánchez Cordero, then a top administration official, was gifted a cannabis plant by senator on the Senate floor, and she said she’d be making it a part of her personal garden. A different lawmaker gave Sánchez Cordero, a marijuana joint on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies in 2019. Cannabis made another appearance in the legislature last year, when Sen. Jesusa Rodríguez of the MORENA party decorated her desk with a marijuana plant. Drug policy reform advocates have also been cultivating hundreds of marijuana plants in front of the Senate, putting pressure on legislators to make good on their pledge to advance legalization.

At the meeting of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, officials will discuss a “key resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the party’s 100 years of endeavours,” state media reported this week. Such historical resolutions have only been adopted twice before. Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping both used them to consolidate power and remake the party as they envisioned it. Mr. Xi is expected to defy precedent and secure a third term as leader during the party congress next year. He has already done away with the collective leadership and consensus-based policy making pursued by his predecessor, Hu Jintao. And he has largely sidelined Premier Li Keqiang and taken on so many roles that he has been dubbed “the chairman of everything.” Since reaching the pinnacle of Chinese politics in 2013, Mr. Xi has also used an anti-corruption campaign to purge rivals and shore up popular support while increasing the party’s role in both the economy and everyday life, after decades of retreat under previous leaders. Ryan Manuel, the managing director of Official China, a Hong Kong-based research firm, said news of the summit demonstrates Mr. Xi’s strength within the party, despite reports of infighting and pushback on some parts of his reform program. “If you can get a historical resolution through, that would indicate that you don’t really have problems with your power base,” Dr. Manuel said. Mr. Xi has faced rumours of resistance within the party before, even as his power only grew stronger and support for his agenda more vocal. Critics who have spoken out, such as former Central Party School professor Cai Xia, have been imprisoned or forced to flee overseas. “Over the course of his tenure, the regime has degenerated further into a political oligarchy bent on holding on to power through brutality and ruthlessness,” Ms. Cai wrote earlier this year. “It has grown even more repressive and dictatorial. A personality cult now surrounds Xi, who has tightened the party’s grip on ideology and eliminated what little space there was for political speech and civil society.” Another former Central Party School official, Deng Yuwen, has suggested that a new historical resolution could empower Mr. Xi to address his internal critics and rationalize abandoning the post-Mao consensus on term limits and economic reforms. The last time the party adopted a resolution on history was in 1981, when Deng Xiaoping used it to renounce many of the missteps of the Mao era, particularly the Cultural Revolution, which “led to domestic turmoil and brought catastrophe to the party, the state and the whole people.” Mr. Xi’s family suffered greatly during the Cultural Revolution. His father was expelled from the party and jailed, and one of his sisters was “persecuted to death” by the Red Guards. But as leader, Mr. Xi has emphasized the need for a “correct outlook on history,” one that downplays previous missteps in favour of a narrative of constant success on the path to the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” Chinese President Xi Jinping, centre, Premier Li Keqiang, right, and high profile officials stand near the Monument to the People's Heroes during a ceremony to mark Martyr's Day at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Sept. 30, 2021. Xi paid respects at a solemn commemoration Thursday for those who died in the struggle to establish Communist Party rule, as he leads a national drive to reinforce patriotism and single-party authority.Andy Wong/The Associated Press A new historical resolution is unlikely to go so far as rehabilitating the Cultural Revolution, most observers agree, but it could recast it as more of a blip. It could also provide an official take on the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 – one that supports the party’s hostility toward democratic reform. The resolution could also set the stage for more sweeping changes in Mr. Xi’s third term. In recent months, he has spoken of the need to advance “common prosperity,” addressing the rampant inequality that has emerged alongside China’s economic boom. The push has coincided with a major crackdown on the tech sector, which has created many of the country’s billionaires; increased pressure on companies to donate more to charities; and efforts to reform the real estate market, which have been expedited after the near-collapse of developer Evergrande. “Currently, the world is facing a prominent issue of income inequality,” Mr. Xi said in a recent speech published by the party journal Qiushi last week. “In some countries, the wealth gap and middle-class collapse have aggravated social divisions, political polarization and populism, giving a profound lesson to the world. China must make resolute efforts to prevent polarization, advance common prosperity and realize social harmony and stability.” But while Mr. Xi envisions a more equal distribution of wealth, his is no socialist transformation. He has warned against the “trap of ‘welfarism’ that encourages laziness” and attacked the “lying flat” movement, which sees young people abandoning the striving, consumerist goals of modern China and pursuing a more low-key, less-stressful lifestyle. There also are hints of a more radical transformation not yet openly endorsed by Mr. Xi. In August, writer Li Guangman argued that “a monumental change is taking place in China.” The previously little-known blogger’s article was widely republished by state media, including the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, indicating at least tacit support for his arguments at high levels within the party. According to Mr. Li, China’s economic, financial, cultural and political spheres are already undergoing “a profound revolution,” one that will “wash away all the dust.” “Capital markets will no longer be paradise for get-rich-quick capitalists, cultural markets will no longer be heaven for sissy-boy stars, and news and public opinion will no longer be in the position of worshipping Western culture,” he wrote. “It is a return to the revolutionary spirit, a return to heroism, a return to courage and righteousness.” This is all occurring in “direct response to an increasingly fraught and complex international landscape,” he continued, “and a direct response to the savage and violent attacks that the U.S. has already begun to launch against China.” Such “wolf warrior” rhetoric was also included in the announcement of the coming historical resolution, a reference to China’s new, assertive style of diplomacy, noted Patricia Thornton, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Oxford. Repeated references to “bullying” and “enslavement” of China by foreign powers “underscore the persistence of a threatening international environment China has historically faced, and it is likely that the resolution will emphasize that such threats continue in the present, necessitating a vigorous, robust and pro-active defence of China’s national interests moving forward,” she said. “Previous resolutions on Party history,” Ms. Thornton added on Twitter, “heralded fairly dramatic shifts in Party policy and practice, but did not appear to pit China and the CCP against the world.” Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

By the company’s own reckoning, its operations should be producing annual revenues of around R$ 30 million ($6 million) if operating within licensing limits. Located inside a conservation area, the company has extracted 32 times more gold than the projected estimate it made to the regulating agency. An embargo has been placed on Gana Gold along with R$ 10 million (US$ 2 million) in fines following reports of illegal activity. A gold mine hidden in the middle of the Brazilian Amazon generated nearly $200 million in revenue in just over a year for Gana Gold Mineração, according to Brazil’s National Mining Agency (ANM). In addition to the unusually high earnings, Gana Gold is also suspect for extracting 32 times more gold than their projected estimates. Now under investigation by the Federal Police, Gana Gold is only able to operate because the municipality of Itaituba where it is located overruled state and federal legislation to license it — and because the ANM turned a blind eye to its operations. The case is an example of the discord between the institutions that should be protecting the Amazon, the permissiveness of governments focused on facilitating mining in the region, and the success of lobbies in Brasilia on the part of federal senators and congressmen in the Bolsonaro administration. A six-month investigation of Gana Gold as it hit its first billion led to the company’s mine in the Amazon. A leader in gold extraction in Brazil’s northern region, Gana Gold is responsible for 18% of all gold mined in the state of Pará, according to the company’s website. Its high level of productivity stands out simply because the operation was slated to extract only 96.53 kilograms of gold, according to information provided by Gana Gold to the sector’s regulating agency. By the company’s own reckoning, its operations should be producing annual revenues of around R$ 30 million ($6 million) if operating within licensing limits. But the company has declared income of over R$ 1 billion ($200 million) since 2020. In the first eight months of 2021, it surpassed the estimates provided to the regulating agency for the year by 32 times. The level of productivity is uncommon: if accurate, it would rank the Gana Gold mine above the planet’s most profitable operations. The average grade (the geological measure of the number of grams of ore per ton of raw material extracted from the earth) would be much higher than those found at neighboring mines. Gana Gold declined a request to be interviewed. The lucrative mine are inside a federally protected area neighboring the Munduruku Indigenous Land in Itaituba, a municipality in the southwest part of Pará State. The region is experiencing an actual gold rush that’s only intensified since the start of the Jair Bolsonaro administration in 2019. Bolsonaro is known to support clandestine prospectors and his administration has been fighting to legalize mining on Indigenous land. It is a market that mobilizes billions of Brazilian reais every year, largely from undercover operations. More than one-fourth of the 174 tons of gold produced in Brazil in 2019 and 2020 was illegally mined, resulting in losses of R$ 9,8 billion ($ 2 billion) for the country according to a study carried out by researchers at Minas Gerais Federal University (UFMG) and by the Federal Prosecutor’s Office (MPF). The study was the basis for four MPF civil action suits in the state of Pará presented in July and August of this year, asking for suspension of prospectors in the region and of financial institutions accused of buying illegal gold until there is more control over sale of the ore. The suit does not apply to industrial gold mining, which is what Gana Gold does. The study also shows that most of this production goes to countries like Canada, the U.K., and Switzerland. In the first half of 2021, the production of gold considered to be potentially illicit remained high, reaching 26% of the 46.8 tons of gold produced over the period, according to researcher Bruno Manzolli from UFMG. Itaituba, where Gana Gold is headquartered, stands out in this scenario. The UFMG researchers show that, together with the municipalities of Jacareacanga and Novo Progresso, Itaituba generated 85.7% of illegal gold sales with designation of origin in untouched areas with native forest between 2019 and 2020. In other words, ore was extracted illegally in other locations. An institutional video produced by Gana Gold shows a large undertaking using heavy machinery and a processing plant. The mine even has its own landing strip built in 2018 on a site that, according to an MPF public civil action suit, was illegally deforested. In the second half of 2020, the company extended the airstrip, which is now 850 meters long. Itaituba is among the municipalities with the worst deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon according to a study by IMAZON (the Institute of Amazonian Man and Environment) published in June of this year. Despite the fact that it is a mega undertaking, the company holds only one license, which was granted by the municipality of Itaituba — even though municipalities have no legal authority to license gold mining. Still, the ANM — the federal regulating agency for the sector — accepted the document and allowed the company to operate in March, 2020, contrary to the agency’s own legal norms. Because of the type of mining carried out there, involving heavy machinery equipped to remove 50,000 tons of earth annually to find gold, and classified as a high environmental risk under federal legislation, the license should be granted by the government of Pará State. Typically during the licensing process, the state secretariat requires a company to carry out an environmental impact study and later present this document to the ICMBio (Chico Mendes Institute of Conservation and Biodiversity), which is the federal regulator for preserved areas. Environmental protection laws on the books also require that the license should only be given if the institute concedes authorization for environmental licensing, or ALA, after analyzing the possible environmental impacts of the proposed activity. In the case of Gana Gold, none of the above was carried out. Fool’s gold Gana Gold’s success story began in June, 2016 when a company called J.J.G.E. filed a gold ore research request for an area comprising 4,183 hectares near Água Branca, a prospecting community in Itaituba settled at the end of the 1970 s . The site had been studied by another mining company, Brazauro Recursos Minerais, between 2006 and 2013. It concluded a report on the financials of exploration and the site was abandoned definitively in 2015. Brazauro’s 2015 report also affirms that the company reported the presence of illegal prospectors at the location in 2012. Satellite images show that by 2016 there was illegal prospecting going on at the mine under the umbrella of J.J.G.E. It is impossible, however, to determine exactly who was responsible for the activity. Then at the start of 2017, J.J.G.E. was given a license from the government mining regulators at the ANM to carry out a new study. That study found that the mine would be economically viable for exploration. After the study, the next step would have been to seek permission to remove the ore — what the ANM classifies as a “mining concession requirement.” However, the company chose to take an easier route to be able to start operations and requested a Guide for Use (GU) for experimental mining — a type of simplified authorization for extraction that can be granted during the research phase. Although it involves less bureaucracy, a GU requires the applying party to present an environmental license. This means that in order to remove ore, the company must seek out the appropriate environmental agencies and present and environmental impact analysis together with a compensation proposal. This is not what J.J.G.E. did. In April 2018, the company instead handed the mine over to M.M. Gold Mineração, owned by Marcio Macedo Sobrinho, the current author of the mining requirement. The licensing process should have been carried out by the Pará State Government, under jurisdiction of the State Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainability, or SEMAS. According to the full text of the mining process filed at the agency, the company even requested a license from the state secretariat in December 2018, but then changed its strategy. According to the company, though, it was only after “gaining knowledge” that the request could be made with the municipal environmental agency — even though, in reality, the municipal secretary has no authorization to grant it. Based on this interpretation, the company used loopholes in established procedures and gained a license from City Hall in Itaituba to operate in just nine days. A document sent to the ANM on September 16, 2019 demonstrates the unusually rapid approval process. Typically, according to two environmental analysts interviewed for this report, this procedure takes anywhere from 30-60 days in order to carry out an analysis of relevant environmental impact documents. The remarkably short time frame becomes even more confounding when one Guilherme Aggens enters the story. A forestry engineer and partner in Geoconsult, a consulting firm for the mining industry that had carried out some technical studies for Gana Gold, Aggens has a history of travel with politicians to Brasilia to lobby for the sector. The company granted him power of attorney on September 24 — eight days after it applied for the operating license with the city — granting him power over all administrative procedures regarding the mine with the Environmental Departments of the state of Pará, of Itaituba and also with the ANM. On the following day, the city’s Secretary of the Environment and Mining, Bruno Rolim da Silva, granted Gana Gold the license. The dates could be a mere coincidence if, a week before, Aggens hadn’t posted photos of himself on a trip with Rolim on social media to lobby for the mining sector in Brasilia. The posts show meetings with politicians that support prospecting in the Amazon, especially on Indigenous lands, like senator Joaquim Passarinho of the PSD party of Pará and Itaituba city councilman Wescley Tomaz of the MDB party. During the trip, they also managed time in the agenda of then-Chief of Staff, senator Onyx Lorenzoni, close ally of President Jair Bolsonaro, who today is Minister of Labor and Social Security. Senator Joaquim Passarinho and councilman Wescley Tomaz are also frequently seen on visits to heads of Ministries in the national capital for the purpose of lobbying, especially for the loosening of laws regarding prospecting in the Amazon. In May of this year, Tomaz and Aggens met with then-minister of the Environment Ricardo Salles, who openly supports prospecting on Indigenous lands and is currently under investigation by the Federal Police for his involvement with the illegal extraction of wood. Tomaz and Aggens were together in Brasilia once again at the end of August, this time to participate in a hearing by the Congressional Commission of Mines and Energy overseen by senator Passarinho to discuss the legalization of illegal prospectors in the Tapajós region. Aggens and Rolim’s relationship doesn’t appear to have begun with the Gana Gold mine. Both also appear standing together with the newly-elected Jair Bolsonaro in a photo published in November 2018 by attorney Fernando Brandão, a resident of Itaituba. A year later, Brandão would participate, together with prospectors, in a secret meeting with Ministers Ricardo Salles and Onyx Lorenzoni to place pressure on the government to punish IBAMA officials who had burned machinery used in environmental crimes. City Hall of Itaituba was contacted about the mistakes in the license granted Gana Gold on July 14 asking which environmental legislation allows a municipality to grant a license for the mining company’s activity. No response was received. Secretary Bruno Rolim da Silva was contacted directly via WhatsApp on his personal number as to whether his relationship with engineer Guilherme Aggens influenced the fact that the concession was emitted in only nine days. No response was received, but there was a reaction from the company. Also on July 14 about five hours after the inquiries were sent, Gana Gold filed a partial cession request with the ANM to transfer 4,001 hectares of M.M. Gold’s solicitation, which was originally for 4,183 hectares. However, the gold mine is situated precisely on the 182 hectares that were left to M.M. This is also where the processing plant and the landing strip are located. Aggens never answered the questions I sent to him asking for an explanation on why this change was requested, coincidentally, on the same day that I had questioned the company. The mine’s authorization is also missing another important stamp of approval: that of ICMBio. As the operation lies within a federal conservation unit — the Tapajós Environmentally Protected Area bordering the Munduruku Indigenous Territory — the license should only be granted after ICMBio authorizes it. Incidentally, this requirement for ICMBio approval could cease to exist if the bill altering environmental licensing, which was approved in Brazil’s congress in May, is passed by the Senate and made into law. Three inquiry emails were sent between July and August to ICMBio’s press office, but the only response came from the agency for the Information Access Law (LAI) on September 1. “At no point in time was any communication sent to ICMBio from environmental agencies, state or municipal, about environmental licensing for the mining process 850.397/2016 [the registry for the mine where Gana Gold extracts], which is for mineral research with a Guide for Use, in which case an environmental license and ICMBio authorization are obligatory,” states the agency response. The bureaucratic soap opera ended in March, 2020 when the ANM shrugged off Brazilian environmental legislation and accepted the illegal document presented by Gana Gold, conceding permission for the company to mine 36.6 hectares — the area where extraction takes place withing the 4,183 hectares included in the original petition. Carolina Santana, an attorney for the Human Rights Observatory for Isolated and Recently Contacted Indigenous Peoples, argues that processes already in place can’t simply be set aside. “You are not allowed to choose the licensing agency for your undertaking,” Santana said in an interview. “Environmental legislation determines this. Independent of who made mistakes in this case, there are a number of illegal elements in this licensing process that must be investigated, mostly because of the presence of Indigenous communities in the APA Tapajós region.” The Pará Agreement As of September 2021, the Pará state government had not directly analyzed Gana Gold’s mining project because the company did not request its license from the state agency. In February, Pará Governor Helder Barbalho signed an agreement with six companies, including Gana Gold, to promote the gold industry in the state. The objective is to refine the ore in the state. The grave errors in Gana Gold’s licensing process haven’t yet gotten a response from Barbalho’s administration. An email sent to his cabinet and to SEMAS requesting information about the agreement made with the company and asking if the government plans to maintain the agreement. A press officer from SEMAS did respond that they had granted no licenses to Gana Gold. Queries sent to gubernatorial advisors via WhatsApp received no response. Gana Gold’s mine lies in the Tapajós Gold Province in the southwest of Pará, where conflicts over the precious metal are a threat the Munduruku Indigenous people and conservation units in the area. Professor Luiz Jardim Wanderley from the Geography Department at Fluminense Federal University (UFF) explains, “There are three factors at work bringing more prospecting to the Tapajós region: first, a surplus of manpower because of the unemployment rate and Brazil’s economic situation, which was worsened by the pandemic; second, the rising price of gold; and third, of course, the actions the Bolsonaro administration has taken to weaken environmental controls, which encourages those investing in illegal mining.” Wanderley coordinated the report O Cerco do Ouro [The Gold Siege] together with researcher Luísa Molina for the National Committee for the Defense of Territories Against Mining. Published in April 2021, the document analyzes increased illegal mining on Munduruku lands. In the Brazilian market, the price of gold is US dollar denominated. During times of economic crisis, it becomes a safe port for investors, which drives up the price. This was one of the factors that caused the price of gold to double between 2019 and 2020, reaching R$ 379 ($75) per gram between August and November last year. As vaccination moved forward in 2021, the price fell and is now around R$ 300 ($60)—a value 50% higher than before the pandemic. Gold Multiplied With its license in hand in March 2020, Gana Gold began extracting gold and generated R$ 235 million ($47 million) during its first year of operations. Its performance ranked sixth among the state’s largest mining companies according to ANM data. But it hasn’t all been easy for the company. In June, it was robbed by armed men who took 20 kilos of gold. No one has been arrested yet for the theft. In 2021 alone, Gana Gold expanded its operation and reached R$ 883 million ($176 million) by August. However, according to the production estimate report that the company delivered to the ANM in October 2019, extraction at the site should generate up to 96.53 kg per year, which would result in estimated total annual revenue of around R$ 30 million ($6 million). In order to generate R$ 883 million in revenues in 2021, Gana Gold would have to remove 3.14 tons of gold from its mine in the Amazon — 32 times its production estimate. This calculation relies on the same research methodologies as UFMG on illegal gold production cited by the federal prosecutor’s Office, which takes into consideration the information on weight and average gold prices in the tax month informed by the company on the ANM open data website. In the opinion of researcher Luiz Jardim Wanderley, this discrepancy in values indicates that Gana Gold is extracting much more gold that it informed the ANM about. “When it got its operating license quickly without having to go through the process of requesting a mining concession, the company produced no detailed analysis of incurrent environmental damage, nor did it promote the necessary public debate on those impacts, which is mandatory,” Wanderley said in an interview. “At any rate, the Guide for Use requires the company to present the appropriate environmental licenses. As the GU is supposedly used for smaller volumes, the environmental agencies ask for simplified procedures. However, Gana Gold has been operating at levels equal to an industrial mine.” The large volume of ore extracted by Gana Gold in Itaituba also raises doubts as to the type of permission that was granted by the ANM, which was for experimental mining, comments Edson Farias Mello, Geology professor at Rio de Janeiro Federal University. “It is uncommon for a gold mine to be developed under a Guide for Use, unless you’re talking about the initial phases for determining the character of the ore,” Mello said. “The concept of experimental mining covered by the GU is compatible with small volumes, which does not appear to the be the case [of Gana Gold. While the concession can take years to be granted, a GU is released in just a few months.” But again on September 9, Gana Gold ran into trouble. Around 30 Federal Police agents arrived at Gana Gold and served warrants to the company. They collected gold samples to verify whether the ore has the same geological characteristics as 39 kilograms of illegal gold seized at Jundiaí airport in the state of São Paulo in August. During the operation, which was dubbed “Gold Rush,” Federal Police also arrested a man for carrying a gun with a serial number that had been scratched off. In a statement, without mentioning the name of Gana Gold, the Federal Police stated that the GU “was used to lend a legal appearance to illicit transactions involving a large volume of gold of spurious origin.” According to the Federal Police the details of the ongoing investigation can’t be disclosed. They also state that those responsible could be held liable for crimes of usurpation of national assets, misrepresentation, illegal occupation of public lands, criminal organization and several other crimes against the flora. The exorbitant numbers placed the Tapajós region’s new mining company at the top of the ranking of the state’s gold miners — up from sixth place — leaving behind companies with decades in the sector. Not bad for a company that holds no environmental license from the appropriate agency. The volume reported by Gana Gold does not appear to be new information to the ANM — data on the operation is available on the agency’s website. The agency also, in a communication regarding the company’s mining process, admitted at the beginning of the year that it is “favorable to” the company’s goal to expand the mine, and highlighted that “the project is important within the mineral sector’s portfolio.” I contacted ANM staff for further explanation. The agency’s ombudsman, Paulo Santana, responded that there is “nothing abnormal or illegal” in the case of Gana Gold. The response also said that the “mine’s grade” could be as high as “20 grams/ton.” This information is not coherent with the geological study presented by Gana Gold, which indicated an average grade ten times lower, of just 1.97 g/t. “We are obligated to stimulate and foment the mineral sector,” wrote Santana in response to questions regarding the ANM’s position on Gana Gold’s expansion. The ombudsman’s evaluation also ignores the company’s practical performance reported to the ANM last year. According to the data declared by the company, the mine in Itaituba has recorded an average grade of 62.70 g/t — based on the supposition that the company is operating legally. Last year, Kitco, a site specialized in mining, highlighted a mine in Australia with the highest average grade of gold per ton in the world, of 42.4 g/t. In other words, lower than Gana Gold. Nugget city Itaituba’s economy is driven by the gold business — both legal and illegal. The town’s mayor, Valmir Climaco, is an ex-prospector and prospecting enthusiast in the pandemic who has been the object of several complaints and was condemned in 2019 for illegal deforestation of 746 hectares of native forest in a preserved area. That same year, the Federal Police found weapons and nearly 600 kg of cocaine on one of his farms in Itaituba. In a statement, he affirmed that the property had squatters living on it and that he had no relationship with the criminals imprisoned during the operation. This is the history that led City Hall in Nugget City — as Itaituba is called — to grant Gana Gold its operating license. The document has serious informational errors, including citations of environmental laws that contradict the license itself. The document’s first error has to do with the type of activity. In its title, the city states that Gana Gold has applied for Mineral Research with Experimental Mining, but on the next page, it refers to the PLG, or Permit for Prospect Mining, which is a more rudimentary activity, different from the license granted and with a simplified license. It also cites a particular distinction which deals with prospecting. “Judging from the equipment used by the company and its processing — which includes crushing rocky material — it is clear that the company is working with primary ore,” stated geologist Edson Farias Mello in an interview. “Therefore, the activity cannot be classified as prospecting. This legislation defines that the Prospecting Permit, or PLG, can only be granted in places where gold occurs in secondary deposits.” The error could have been just a mistake made by the municipal agency if it weren’t for one small detail: according to the state environmental legislation, City Hall does not have the autonomy to grant licenses for experimental mining, only for mining prospectors. The operating license granted by City Hall to Gana Gold cites resolution No 116 of the State Environmental Council (COEMA), which specifies that municipalities can only grant the prospecting permit (PLG) or the “mineral research without experimental mining”. At the time when the license was granted, the valid COEMA resolution was No. 120, which presented the same mining rules as the resolution published the previous year. Article 1 of the resolution, which has validity as legislation, specifies another error committed: not consulting the federal environmental agency responsible for the management of Brazilian Conservation Units. The resolution also states clearly federal and state agencies must be consulted for the licensing of activities or undertakings which will have local environmental impact inside State or Federal Conservation Units.” In February, the state council published new regulation on the types of licensing that city governments can grant, which maintains the same requirements. When questioning the ANM about the irregular licensing of Gana Gold, I mentioned the environmental legislation that prohibits the municipality of Itaituba from granting licenses for experimental gold mining. Even so, without presenting any document or regulation to support his answer, ombudsman Paulo Santana wrote that “this technical body is aware that the municipality of Itaituba, PA has authorization for municipal environmental management, which was granted by the State Environmental Department (SEMES).” Santana also reinforced that “It is not up to the technical staff of the ANM to validate these documents.” SEMAS, in turn, says such authorization does not exist. I questioned the state secretary on August 8 after receiving the email from the ANM’s ombudsman, and the response they sent me was that, beyond the federal legislation and the COEMA norms, “There is no instrument in force delegating competence between the State and the municipality of Itaituba for the classification ‘mineral research with experimental mining’.” Clandestine runway In a video released by the company, a helicopter and an airplane are seen landing at the mine — yet another signal that it is a large operation. Neither the heliport nor the runway is registered with Brazil’s National Aviation Agency (ANAC). They are clandestine. In July, ANAC’s press office said the case was being checked by the agency’s “intelligence sector” and indicated possible punishment for those responsible. But Gana Gold doesn’t need to concern itself with this for now, because in early June, the agency published a temporary ruling allowing take-offs and landings in unregistered places within the Brazilian Amazon. The justification given by the government was “to facilitate the transport of medicines, supplies and patients to communities in these regions” during the pandemic. The area where the 106-hectare airstrip was built was illegally deforested in 2018, according to a lawsuit filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Pará, which cites Nill Vitor da Silva, the registered owner of the land in the CAR (Rural Environmental Registry) system. Registers in the CAR are self-declared, and Silva’s is listed as still “pending”. Silva’s name does not appear anywhere as a Gana Gold partner. This could be the reason why the complaint filed by the Prosecutor’s Office, made by the Amazônia Protege program — which uses data from INPE and IBAMA to hold deforesters accountable — does not mention that the deforested site serves as a clandestine landing strip for the mining company. Public documents also indicate that the land operated by Gana Gold may be irregular. Through the Mapbiomas platform — a project run by environmental NGOs and universities — one can see that, aside from Nill Vitor da Silva, the area occupied by the mine comprises an area of 405 hectares also registered in the CAR registry system, also listed as “pending.” It is registered under the name Sebastião Luiz da Silva, who also has no apparent connection to the Gana Gold group. The name Márcio Macedo Sobrinho also comes up in the CAR registry as owner of the precise 402 hectares where the mine is located, next to the land that would belong to Nill Vitor and Sebastião da Silva. Sobrinho’s registration, made in July 2019, comes up as “suspended” in the CAR system in Pará. Attempts to contact Gana Gold partners Márcio Macedo Sobrinho and Domingos Dadalto Zoboli were unsuccessful and there was no answer at the numbers registered in the ANM mining process. Emails to the company were returned as having an invalid address. The same questions were sent via email to engineer Guilherme Aggens, who said by WhatsApp that he would look at the content, but he did not respond to questions about why the company is extracting 32 times the limit established by the ANM, why ownership of the land is registered in the CAR system under three different names, or even as to Aggens’ relationship with Itaituba’s Secretary of the Environment, Bruno Rolim da Silva. In a response via Brazil’s Information Access Law, ICMBio informed me that the agency only found out about Gana Gold’s activities “by means of an institutional video being passed among WhatsApp groups in the region,” and that it began to investigate the case at the time, in April of this year. Finally, after the Portuguese version of this article was published in The Intercept Brasil on September 16 exposing Gana Gold’s activities, ICMBio decided to take a harder stance regarding the company. On September 23, agents of the federal environmental agency seized the operation and fined Gana Gold R$ 10 million ($ 2 million) for “building, installing and operating a polluting establishment without environmental licensing,” based on article 66 of decree 6514/ 2008. The embargo affects the entire 4,000-hectare area of the Gana Gold mining process within the Tapajós Environmentally Protected Area. This article was originally published in Portuguese in The Intercept Brasil and is part of the Pistas do Desmatamento project, which investigates the environmental impacts related to clandestine airstrips in the Amazon, a partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network."

Droughts will hurt food production, rising temperatures will encourage the spread of dangerous pathogens such as malaria and cholera and current climate trends indicate a ""code red"" for future health, the new report in The Lancet medical journal predicts. The Lancet Countdown report, published annually, tracks 44 metrics of the health impacts of climate change, including the impact of climate change on infectious disease transmission and food production, as researched by experts affiliated with more than 40 UN groups and educational institutions. The report said during a 6 month period in 2020, 51.6 million people were impacted by 84 disasters from floods, droughts, and storms in countries already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. ""The 2021 report of the Lancet Countdown finds a world overwhelmed by an ongoing global health crisis, which has made little progress to protect its population from the simultaneously aggravated health impacts of climate change,"" the report authors wrote. Climate impacts on health identified in the report included increased droughts hurting food production, more violent natural disasters placing burdens on health care systems, and rising temperatures encouraging the spread of infectious pathogens. The report said climate change contributed to a record-breaking heatwave in the US Pacific Northwest that caused more than 1,000 deaths. ""Looking to 2021, people older than 65 years or younger than 1 year, along with people facing social disadvantages, were the most affected by the record-breaking temperatures of over 40°C in the Pacific Northwest areas of the USA and Canada in June, 2021— an event that would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change,"" the authors wrote. Dr. Jeremy Hess, a global health and emergency medicine professor at the University of Washington and a co-author on the report, said in a media briefing that he has seen some of these health effects firsthand. ""I was taking care of patients in two of our hospitals out here in Seattle during the heat dome and unfortunately this was the first year I can say confidently that I and my patients very clearly experienced the impacts of climate change. I saw paramedics who had burns on their knees from kneeling down to care for patients with heatstroke. And I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure this past year,"" Hess said. Climate change contributing to the spread of disease According to the report, rising temperatures have resulted in an increase in the number of months where malaria is transmissible since the 1950s, and an increase in the number of areas suitable for cholera transmission. The ""epidemic potential"" of viruses including dengue and Zika increased globally. ""Together with global mobility and urbanization, climate change is a major driver of the increase in the number of dengue virus infections, which have doubled every decade since 1990,"" the report's authors write. ""Other important emerging or re-emerging arboviruses, transmitted by mosquitoes, are likely to have a similar response to climate change."" How a 'green recovery' from Covid-19 can help Hess said global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could worsen an already dire situation, particularly if it is not a ""green recovery."" ""The world has invested tremendous resources in recovery, but not taken the opportunity to invest those resources in a green recovery that isn't fueled by fossil fuels. And this unfortunately is a lost opportunity for us. We could be investing in a healthier future, and as of right now, and of course this is a pivotal moment in politics in the United States and globally, related to climate change, we need to seize that opportunity,"" Hess said. Released ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of the Parties, the report highlights the importance of global climate action, like the Paris Agreement, on global health. ""Neither Covid-19 nor climate change respect national borders. Without widespread, accessible vaccination across all countries and societies, Sars-CoV-2 and its new variants will continue to put the health of everybody at risk. Likewise, tackling climate change requires all countries to deliver an urgent and coordinated response, with Covid-19 recovery funds allocated to support and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon future and climate change adaptation across the globe,"" report authors said. ""By directing the trillions of dollars that will be committed to Covid-19 recovery towards the WHO's prescriptions for a healthy, green recovery, the world could meet the Paris Agreement goals, protect the natural systems that support well-being, and minimize inequities through reduced health effects and maximized co-benefits of a universal low-carbon transition."" ""Every fraction of a degree matters for health inequity and the US has an opportunity to make the urgent sweeping actions that we need to protect health,"" Dr. Renee Salas, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School who contributed to the report, told CNN. ""Climate change is first and foremost a health crisis that is unfolding right now and as an emergency medicine doctor I took an oath to protect the health of my patients, and I can't do that without action (on) climate change. So, improving health and accelerating equity, must not only be the reason we act, but it also has to guide how we respond"" 'We're about to do the same mistake again' Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, who did not contribute to the report, told the briefing the pandemic offers a way to better prepare for climate change as a health crisis on a global scale. ""We've just spent many years preparing and talking about a pandemic, and quite frankly, we were not prepared. We did not put the infrastructure in place that we actually needed to put in place. We de-invested in ... our health and public health systems in ways that quite tragically resulted in two years of significant outbreak that did not have to be as bad as it was,"" he said. ""The real issue here is that we're about to do the same mistake again. We're about to have the same things happen to us because we have not really invested in the mitigation and adaptation that is necessary to address climate change."" Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. In an editorial released with the report referenced research on what has made societies resilient against climate issues in the past. ""These pathways are: exploiting new opportunities, developing resilient energy systems, utilizing trade and resources, forging political and institutional adaptations, and migration and transformation,"" the editorial authors wrote. ""The key message is that the world needs a new era of research that is less focused on forecasts for climate change, and more on predictions of the societal consequences of future warming and how to weather them.

(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File) BEIRUT (AP) — The judge leading Lebanon’s probe into last year’s massive port explosion renewed on Tuesday his summonses of two former ministers for questioning, a judicial official said. The decision by Judge Tarek Bitar came despite intense criticism from the country’s powerful Hezbollah group of the direction of the long-running investigation. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has accused Bitar of politicizing the probe and singling out some officials and not others. He has called on the government to remove Bitar. Bitar has been in the post since February, after his predecessor was removed by a court decision following legal challenges from senior government officials who were also summoned. Nasrallah’s accusations marked a major escalation in rhetoric targeting Bitar and were followed by protests in the capital Beirut last week by supporters of Hezbollah and its ally Amal against the judge. The protests descended into violence unseen in Lebanon in years: Seven people were killed during five hours of clashes between supporters of the two Shiite groups and gunmen accused of being allied with Lebanon’s right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces. ADVERTISEMENT His critics held Bitar responsible for the bloodshed. But on Tuesday, the judge went ahead with summoning two former government ministers, one of them an ally of Hezbollah, for questioning regarding the port blast. Bitar had issued arrest warrants for the two ex-ministers but with the resumption of parliament sessions Tuesday following a recess, the ministers reclaimed parliamentary immunity, which had shielded them from previous interrogation. The two former ministers, Ghazi Zeitar and Nohad Machnouk, are also lawmakers. They were summoned to appear Oct. 29, the judicial official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The former ministers’ legal teams argue that with parliamentary immunity in place, the officials are exempt from appearing before the judge. But according to the parliament’s bylaws, Bitar can renew his summonses because he first called for their questioning in a period when parliament was in recess — at a time when the two men had briefly lost their immunity. Legal experts have called it the “battle of immunities” as the defendants and the lead judge have looked for loopholes in the law to each get their way. The result has been interruptions of the investigation, which is centered on what caused the explosion of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive fertilizer often used to make bombs, stored in the port for years. Independent media and rights groups have revealed that senior government officials knew of the material stored in the port but did nothing to store it properly or warn the public of its presence and danger. More than 215 people died and over 6,000 were injured in the blast that devastated parts of the city Beirut."

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, File) ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — U.N. agencies are gearing up to vaccinate all of Afghanistan’s children under 5 against polio for the first time since 2018, after the Taliban agreed to the campaign, the World Health Organization says. For the past three years, the Taliban barred U.N.-organized vaccination teams from doing door-to-door campaigns in parts of Afghanistan under their control, apparently out of suspicion they could be spies for the government or the West. Because of the ban and ongoing fighting, some 3.3 million children over the past three years have not been vaccinated. The Taliban’s reported agreement now, after becoming the rulers of Afghanistan, appeared aimed at showing they are willing to cooperate with international agencies. The longtime militant insurgent force has been trying to win the world’s recognition of its new government and re-open the door for international aid to rescue the crumbling economy. ADVERTISEMENT The Taliban leadership did not confirm its agreement, and Taliban officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But WHO and the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said in a statement Monday that they welcomed the decision by the Taliban leadership supporting the resumption of house-to-house polio vaccinations across the country. Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan are the only countries in the world where polio remains endemic. The disease can cause partial paralysis in children. Since 2010, the country has been carrying out regular inoculation campaigns in which workers go door to door, giving the vaccine to children. Most of the workers are women, since they can get better access to mothers and children. But large sections of the country have been out of their reach in recent years. In parts of the south, particularly, the ban by the Taliban was in effect. In other areas, door-to-door campaigns were impossible because of fighting between the government and the insurgents, or because of fears of kidnappings or roadside bombs. In some places, hard-line clerics spoke out against vaccinations, calling them un-Islamic or a Western plot. WHO said a new nationwide vaccination campaign will begin on Nov. 8, followed by another synchronized with Pakistan’s polio vaccination campaign in December. The estimated target population is Afghanistan’s 10 million children under 5, including the more than 3.3 million who could not be reached since 2018, Dr. Hamid Jafari, WHO’s director of polio eradication for the Eastern Mediterranean region, told The Associated Press. “Restarting polio vaccination in all areas of Afghanistan now will prevent a major resurgence of polio outbreaks within the country and ensure there is no international spread,” Jafari said. ADVERTISEMENT “This is an extremely important step in the right direction,” said Dapeng Luo, WHO Representative in Afghanistan. He said it was a good sign that multiple campaigns are planned. “Sustained access to all children is essential to end polio for good.” On March 30, three women were gunned down in two separate attacks as they carried out door-to-door vaccinations in the eastern city of Jalalabad. It was the first time vaccination workers have been killed in a decade of door-to-door inoculations against the disease in Afghanistan. Such attacks have been more common in Pakistan, where at least 70 vaccinators and security personnel connected to vaccination campaigns have been killed since 2011. Jafari said the Taliban’s previous ban in its areas was “mainly for security reasons,” not out of opposition to vaccinations themselves. The Taliban, he said, have committed to “the absolute protection and security of all health workers and all frontline workers” in the campaign. In Pakistan, officials have struggled to overcome deep public suspicion over vaccines particularly since the U.S. used a fake vaccination campaign to unearth the hideout of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Hard-line clerics and militants have stoked the fears by depicting polio vaccinations as a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Afghanistan and Pakistan have seen an increase in cases. In Afghanistan, 56 new polio cases were reported in 2020, the highest number since 2011, when 80 cases were registered. Only one case of the wild virus has been reported in 2021 in Afghanistan. “This decision will allow us to make a giant stride in the efforts to eradicate polio,” said Hervé Ludovic De Lys, UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan. “To eliminate polio completely, every child in every household across Afghanistan must be vaccinated, and with our partners, this is what we are setting out to do,” he said. A supplementary dose of vitamin A will also be provided to children aged 6 to 59 months during the upcoming campaign. Jafari said the Taliban government had agreed on three key aspects — security for health workers and vaccinators, mobilization of health authorities and the new leadership for the campaign, and communications through religious, tribal and community leaders and media to build trust in the campaign. He urged families not to be suspicious of the vaccinators going house to house, saying the only intention is to protect children. “They should trust the program. They should trust the vaccine.”"

This is because the hacker stole a database containing the ID card details for Argentina’s entire population of nearly 46 million people, The Record has reported. And even worse news is the hacker is reportedly selling that data in private circles, providing a potential goldmine of personal data for future exploits, scams and attacks. Argentinian breach According to the Record the hack took place in September, and it compromised Argentina’s RENAPER, which stands for Registro Nacional de las Personas. This is translated as the National Registry of Persons. This is an agency that is reportedly a crucial part of the Argentinian Interior Ministry, where it is tasked with issuing national ID cards to all citizens in Argentina. The collected ID card data is stored in a database that can be accessed by other branches and agencies of the Argentinian government, and reportedly acts as a backbone for most government queries for citizen’s personal information. According to the Record, the first evidence that someone breached RENAPER surfaced earlier this month on Twitter when a newly registered account named @AnibalLeaks published ID card photos and personal details for 44 Argentinian celebrities. This included the ID card details of the country’s president Alberto Fernández, multiple journalists and political figures, and even data for football superstars such as Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero. A day after the images and personal details were published on Twitter, the hacker also posted an ad on a well-known hacking forum, offering to look up the personal details of any Argentinian user. As local media picked up the data breach, the Argentinian government confirmed the breach three days later. The government’s Ministry of Interior issued a press release in which it said its security team discovered that a VPN account assigned to the Ministry of Health was used to query the RENAPER database for 19 photos “in the exact moment in which they were published on the social network Twitter.” Officials added that “the [RENAPER] database did not suffer any data breach or leak,” and authorities are now currently investigating eight government employees about having a possible role in the leak. Whole database However, The Record contacted the individual who was renting access to the RENAPER database on hacking forums. In a conversation, the hacker said they have a copy of the RENAPER data, contradicting the government’s official statement. The individual proved their statement by providing the personal details, including the highly sensitive Trámite number, of an Argentinian citizen of our choosing. “Maybe in a few days I’m going to publish [the data of] 1 million or 2 million people,” the RENAPER hacker apparently told The Record. The hacker also reported said they plan to continue selling access to this data to all interested buyers. There have been other security breaches in previous years in Argentina, including the Gorra Leaks in 2017.

Besides violating the currency system, Valliollah Seif also had a role in smuggling foreign currency, judiciary spokesman Zabihollah Khodaeian told state TV. Ahmad Araghchi, a then-deputy to Seif, was sentenced to eight years on the same charges, Khodaeian said. Eight others were also sentenced to various prison terms, he said. All of the defendants have the right to appeal. Seif was governor of Iran’s central bank for five years until 2018 under former President Hassan Rouhani. Araghchi was his deputy from 2017 to 2018. State TV said they were involved in violations of the currency market in 2016, a time when the Iranian rial sustained considerable losses in value against major foreign currencies. ADVERTISEMENT The defendants illegally injected $160 million and 20 million euros into the market, state TV said. The rial exchange rate was at 39,000 to $1 in 2017 at the beginning of Araghchi’s time in office but it reached more than 110,000 to $1 by the time he was dismissed in 2018. The change partly coincided with severe U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran. The rial has tumbled from a rate of around 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to around 27,000 rials to $1 in recent months. The currency unexpectedly rallied for some time after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the nuclear deal and reimpose crippling trade sanctions on Iran in 2018. The sanctions have caused Iran’s oil exports, the country’s main source of income, to fall sharply."

Super Saturday hit its 100,000 target by 3pm, and carried on into the night with 129,995 Covid-19 vaccine doses administered for the day. The result smashes the previous record set on August 26, when 92,164 jabs were given. Health Director-General Dr Ashley Bloomfield was thrilled with the day, which included 39,024 first doses and 90,971 second doses. Auckland now has 89 per cent of its eligible population with at least one dose. “People have turned out in droves to the 783 vaccination sites around the motu for their vaccinations – from free hangi at Pôtahi Marae in Northland’s Te Kao to vaccinations on the TSS Earnslaw on Lake Wakatipu in Queenstown,” Dr Bloomfield said in a statement after vaccinations stopped at 10pm.

I want to thank Māori providers for the enormous amount of mahi that has gone into making today such a success. “It was also a great day for the Pacific community with 4223 first doses and 8093 second doses.” Kate Green/Stuff Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield at the Takapuwahia Marae vaccination pop-up event in Porirua on 'Super Saturday'. Breaking down the numbers Super Saturday is not only the most successful Saturday for doses given; by 7pm, 36 per cent more doses had been given than on any other day of the vaccination roll-out. The previous biggest day of the roll-out was August 26, when 92,164 doses were given. This chart shows just how quickly today eclipsed previous Saturday records. Super Saturday also moved the vaccination rate to 85 per cent of the eligible population for at least one dose, and 65 per cent were fully vaccinated with two. “That’s an awesome effort Aotearoa,” Dr Bloomfield said in a statement. “Even if you were not able to get out and get a jab today, don’t worry, there are still lots of opportunities to get vaccinated, with the usual huge range of vaccination sites continuing to operate as normal across the motu beyond this weekend. “Super Saturday has been a shot in the arm for the final stage of our Covid-19 vaccination programme and we now need to finish the job to protect all New Zealanders from the virus.” It was also the biggest day for first doses in a month, with 39,024 people getting their first jab, although this was far off the peak reached in late August when up to 66,000 people a day were lining up for a jab. MONIQUE FORD/Stuff Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern enjoying Super Saturday at the Remakery Fairfield, in Lower Hutt. Looking at the DHBs, Hawke’s Bay and West Coast had the highest turnout by population, managing to deliver vaccines to 4.4 and 4 per cent of their populations by 6pm, respectively. Some DHBs that have been lagging had relatively high turnout too, including Lakes (3.2 per cent) and Northland (3.1 per cent). Tairāwhiti, which currently has the lowest first-dose rates in the country (71.3 per cent) and is home to many isolated, rural communities, also had the lowest Super Saturday turnout. Even there, though, nearly two per cent of the population have had either a first or second jab today. Martin De Ruyter/Stuff People eat free icecream after being vaccinated at a Super Saturday pop-up vaccination site in Motueka. Associate Professor Dr Siouxsie Wiles said hitting the goal was awesome news. Speaking more broadly, she said the most important thing was the first doses, so Kiwis should all be trying to help friends and family who hadn’t yet had their first jab. “If you haven’t got your first dose yet, please remember, it will be five weeks before you are fully vaccinated.” This was because recipients had to wait three weeks between jabs, and it took two weeks after the second jab to reach peak immunity. RICKY WILSON/Stuff Dr Siouxsie Wiles urged Kiwis to help their friends and family to get a jab. On the ground in Auckland Auckland – which continues to be the epicentre of the Delta outbreak and see the vast majority of daily cases – has had almost 35,000 jabs delivered, according to the Ministry of Health. Manurewa Marae clinical lead and registered nurse Nicole Andrews said she always knew the numbers would be high today. The marae itself more than doubled its vaccinations today, nearly reaching 500 on Saturday afternoon, when normally they wouldn’t get 200 on a weekend. Sapeer Mayron/Stuff Manurewa Marae clinical lead and registered nurse Nicole Andrews. Andrews said the incentives make all the difference, as well as the gradual realisation that without high vaccine coverage there is no leaving lockdown. “It means we’re taking more steps forward to protect our whānau and the wider community,” she said. “The more incentives that come through, the more sponsors come through, I think people are going to come forward.” Elsewhere, this was how Super Saturday was received in Wellington and Waikato. ‘We want to keep our baby safe’ Nathaniel Maafu, 22, and Mikayla McMahon, 21, got their first doses on Saturday at Manurewa Marae. The couple have a six-month-old daughter, and McMahon said she wanted to keep her safe. “We have a lot of kids and babies in our family, so I didn’t want to pass it on,” she said. Sapeer Mayron/Stuff Nathaniel Maafu, 22, and Mikayla McMahon, 21, got their first doses of the vaccine on Saturday at Manurewa Marae. “I wasn’t all for it, but now that I have it, it’s a big relief off my shoulders,” McMahon said. Maafu said before today, he had people telling him he was “ruining it for everyone,” and warning him about the elderly at risk. “I wasn’t anti-vax, but I wasn’t for it either. But seeing everyone get it, and nothing’s happened, I thought I may as well try it out,” he said. “In a way that pushed me to come here too, but mostly it was my own choice. I felt like a minority not having the vaccine.” During a televised Vaxathon, a number of celebrities added their voices to the cause, including Lorde and Taika Waititi. Lorde was due to play a series of shows around the country this summer, but said it all depended on Kiwis getting vaccinated. “I cannot wait to come and play a concert, I want to be sweaty, and dancing and maybe not even wearing masks. Hopefully we can get there,” she said."

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Friday's attack in Kandahar, but Islamic State claimed the similar bombing a week earlier that killed scores of Shi'ites in the northern city of Kunduz. Sardar Mohammad Zaidi, imam of the mosque, said there had been four attackers, two of whom blew themselves up at the entrance, allowing the other two to get inside where they detonated their explosives among around 3,000 worshippers just as Friday prayers were ending. A health official at Kandahar's Mirwais hospital told Reuters it had confirmed 41 dead and was treating 70 wounded. The attacks have caused shock and terror among members of Afghanistan's Shi'ite minority and undermine the ruling Taliban movement's claim to have restored security since taking control of the country in August. ""When I arrived at the mosque, I saw injured, dead bodies, and people who had fallen on top of each other,"" said Haji Sarwar Hazara, a local construction contractor who arrived soon after the blast. ""I do not know who did this work, it is the enemy of Islam. But they cannot bring differences among Muslims,"" he said. Photographs and mobile phone footage posted by journalists on social media showed many people apparently dead or seriously wounded on the bloody floor of the Imam Bargah mosque, also known as the Fatima mosque, the largest of around 40 Shi'ite mosques in Kandahar. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said security forces had been ordered to capture the perpetrators and bring them to justice under Islamic law. Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State have repeatedly targeted Shi'ites in the past with large-scale attacks intended to kill civilians, including one that killed scores of schoolgirls in a Shi'ite district of Kabul in May last year. The Taliban are also strict Sunni Muslims but consider Islamic State their enemy and have pledged to protect all ethnic and sectarian groups since sweeping to power in August as US forces withdrew. Taliban soldiers walk in front of protesters during the anti-Pakistan protest in Kabul, Afghanistan, September 7, 2021. (credit: WANA (WEST ASIA NEWS AGENCY) VIA REUTERS) The embassy of Iran, Afghanistan's neighbor and the region's largest Shi'ite power, condemned the attack. ""We hope Taliban leaders take decisive action against these wicked terrorist incidents,"" it said in a Twitter post. The UN mission in Afghanistan said those responsible should be held to account. Taliban special forces arrived to secure the site and an appeal went out to residents to donate blood for the wounded. The blast, coming so soon after the Kunduz attack, underlined uncertainty over security in Afghanistan as the Taliban grapple with an escalating economic and humanitarian crisis that threatens millions with hunger. The local affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan after an ancient name for the region, has stepped up attacks following the Taliban victory over the Western-backed government in Kabul. Taliban officials have played down the threat from Islamic State, and dismissed suggestions they may accept US help to fight the group. But the repeated attacks have caused increasing unease from countries in the region about the potential for militant violence to spill across Afghanistan's borders. That the Shi'ite minority has again been targeted may also inflame tensions among ethnic and sectarian groups in the country, which is largely Sunni Muslim but ethnically diverse. Most Shi'ites in Afghanistan belong to the Hazara ethnic group of Persian speakers, who have complained of persecution under the mainly Pashtun-speaking Taliban in the past."

While officials said the water could contain diesel or kerosene the territory's top doctor doesn't see long-term health concerns for those who drank the water. Water treatment plant operators discovered a concentrated odour in one of its tanks this week, after residents reported smelling fuel in the tap water for over a week. The city told residents not to drink the tap water on Tuesday, and later declared a local state of emergency. Iqaluit Mayor Kenny Bell took questions from across the country Friday on his city's fuel-contaminated water supply. Amy Elgersma, the city's chief administrative officer, left, also took part, along with the territory's chief public health officer, Dr. Michael Patterson, right. (Jacqueline MacKay/CBC) Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut's chief public health officer, said the water contamination has meant Iqaluit operating rooms at the Qikiqtani General Hospital are working with limited capacity and doing emergency surgeries only. ""There was concern that if there was film in the water, surgeons … and the scrub nurses would not be able to properly sterilize [their] hands,"" he said. Another concern is the use of a steam autoclave, a type of sterilizer that uses vapours at high temperatures and under pressure, could be dangerous if it contains fuel components, he said. Instead, Patterson said hospitals are using one-time use instruments as much as possible. He added that will continue for at least the next few days until its known that it's safe to go back to normal operations at the hospital. Amy Elgersma, the city's chief administrative officer, said that in spite of the high concentration of fuel in some water samples, it's difficult to quantify the concentration of fuel components in the water that came out of residents' taps. Do not consume order still in effect A cause of the fuel contamination in the water tank has not been determined yet. Officials said nothing has been ruled out. ""It could be an old spill that's been liberated with [thawing] permafrost, it could be damage to the infrastructure … there's a number of things but it's not natural,"" Patterson said. The order to not drink tap water is still in effect. Patterson said it won't be until at least mid-next week when the city can even think about lifting the do not consume order. Amy Elgersma, Iqaluit's chief administrative officer, says she'll let the public know as soon as they get test results of the city's water. (David Gunn/CBC) In the meantime, the first shipment of 80,000 litres of bottled water, ordered by the city, arrived on Thursday while city trucks and residents collected water from the Sylvia Grinnell River. The Nunavut government also declared the city to be in a state of emergency on Thursday, which allows it to have more authority over assigning its departments and public agencies under the Emergency Measures Act. Long-term effects 'not a concern' Patterson said there are no major health concerns for those who drank contaminated tap water. ""The best evidence that we have available right now indicates that the risk of long-term health effects [are] not a concern at this point,"" Patterson said. People who consumed water that had been contaminated may get headaches, may have gotten upset stomach and diarrhea, he said. ""Symptoms like that would resolve, generally within a few hours as these hydrocarbons pass through their system,"" Patterson said. Contaminated tank bypassed The city has two water tanks in the ground, called the south tank and the north tank. Elgersma said as of Thursday night, the north tank — the one with the contamination — had been isolated. ""The tanks were verified this morning that the valves are holding and the isolation was successful,"" Elgersma said. The city is running water through the south tank now, and it's showing noticeable signs of improvements already including a reduction in odour, she said. That's a ""really positive step,"" Elgersma said. ""Today, we plan on pumping out the tank with the problem. And we will then contain all of that water in holding tanks."" People wait in line for water outside of the public library next to Frobisher Bay. (Emma Tranter/The Canadian Press) Elgersma said the goal Friday is to empty the entire north tank and then, over the weekend, to inspect the tank and look for cracks or compromised areas. ""We're really hopeful that we can resolve this issue quickly,"" she said, adding the city is ""pleased with the success"" of being able to isolate and bypass the problem tank on Thursday. The city also started flushing the water distribution system Thursday and that's expected to continue for another 48 hours. Once that's done, residents will get instructions on how to flush their home pipes by running their water for 20 minutes, Elgersma said. Testing and monitoring will continue over several months. It's suspected that contaminants from outside the plant in the soil or groundwater entered the tank. Elgersma said a consultant would also be carrying out an environmental assessment of the entire water treatment plant site, to look for possible contaminants in the soil. ""There'll be more holes drilled and test pits dug, and so on,"" she said. More bottled water, baby formula coming Elgersma said the city will have a water tank on a trailer set up at each water depot location (the library and the Arctic Winter Games Arena) and it will be replenished by a water truck throughout the day. The Government of Nunavut is expected to bring in more bottled water. Three shipments are expected to arrive by plane on Friday and the territory has ordered water jugs that people can use as well. A sign at Arctic Ventures Marketplace, a grocery store in Iqaluit, shows bottled water was sold out on Thursday. (Matisse Harvey/Radio-Canada) Meanwhile, the city set up a water hotline at 867-979-5603 for those having trouble getting water themselves. Agnico Eagle, which operates several mines in Nunavut, said it's sending 15,000 litres of water to Iqaluit on a cargo flight that is to land on Friday too. Elgersma said pre-mixed baby formula has been ordered as well, some of which will arrive Friday. She said the city is also ordering water pitcher filters, which can be used on water from the river after it's boiled, to bring people more comfort. ""We know it's been extremely difficult for residents, for businesses for everybody involved,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people helping others, bringing water to others and doing whatever they can to help each other, and that's really great to see."""

Now the 26-year-old's experiences, drawn from her incarceration at detention facilities and four notorious penitentiaries around the country, has landed her back in a familiar place -- prison. Gholian was on medical furlough after contracting COVID-19 when a large team of security agents stormed her family's home in the western Khuzestan Province on October 10, arrested her, and took her into detention. Gholian's lawyer, Amir Raisian, wrote on Twitter on October 13 that his client called her family after two days and said she had been taken from the provincial capital, Ahvaz, to the port town of Bushehr, and from there to Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Gholian’s lawyer said his client was transferred to the Tehran facility for ""investigation and interrogation."" As she has been transferred from prison to prison over the years Gholian has specifically requested that she not be sent back to Evin prison where, she told RFE/RL's Radio Farda in an interview last month, she had been ""threatened with death and rape many times."" Her arrest came just days after Gholian posted an image of a summons for her to face charges of ""spreading lies and propaganda"" online against the Iranian government. While the Iranian authorities have not officially made the connection, Gholian’s arrest and transfer to Evin prison appears to be related to a series of tweets she posted on September 9 in which she documented what she said was rampant prisoner abuse during her time at Bushehr Central Prison. Those tweets included accounts of psychological torture, collective punishment, and sex-for-favors practices. In posting the summons she received from the local prosecutor's office, Gholian wrote on September 22 that ""the Islamic Republic has once again proved that its answer to truth and justice is repression and revenge."" Revealing Punishments Just a day before she was summoned to face fresh charges, she expounded on her claims of prisoner abuse in an interview with Radio Farda in which she said she felt as if she had seen the ""ends of the earth."" ""I came to believe that there really might be such a place, because I have been in a public prison ward"" in Iran, said Gholian, whose journey through the country's penal system began at a detention facility in her home province of Khuzestan after her arrest along with other activists during the protests at the Haft Tappeh Sugar Factory. Oil-rich Khuzestan is home to Iran’s Arab minority. The community has long complained of discrimination and say they do not benefit from the province’s wealth. In her tweets, Gholian wrote that inmates at the women's ward of the Bushehr facility are subjected to the ""most savage forms of torture, and are kept in the most inhuman conditions, and their crime is simply that they are women and inmates."" She then posted five separate accounts to back up her claims, including collective punishments for rule violations, being forced to strip naked in front of inmates and prison workers, psychological pressure, forced temporary marriage with male inmates, and coerced sex with guards. Since then, she has been bounced around, starting with Sepidar prison in Khuzestan. While the right to be incarcerated in one's region of residence is enshrined in Iranian law, Gholian told RFE/RL that she had been transferred four times in the space of 30 months with no explanation and despite her requests that she be allowed to serve her sentence within traveling distance of her family. In addition to Sepidar, she has served time in Evin prison; the Qarchak facility southeast of the capital, considered the worst women's prison in Iran; Bushehr; and now, back to Evin. Gholian told RFE/RL that she was fearful of returning to Evin prison and said she had alerted the authorities of the threats she had received there. ""Many times, when I put my head on the pillow, I felt that I would be killed by tomorrow,"" Gholian said in the September interview. ""It is the same now. When I met with the Evin prison judge I told him: 'If you send me back, just know that I will be killed there if the situation is the same."" She said that her notoriety in the media and as an activist might have spared her the harshest treatment, but she was not exempt from routine abuse. She described being grabbed by her hands and feet and kicked and punched by guards. At times Gholian, who has been studying Iran's Islamic law while in prison, was sent into ""quarantine"" merely for exercising her rights. ""As a prisoner, I have the right to lodge complaints"" about prison conditions, she said. But the reality was very different. For example, she said: ""Say I come and ask why there is no water. The security guards are brought in to beat me. They take me to solitary confinement. All this happened while I was there."" 'Human Dignity Is Trampled' She also expounded on some of the obscure forms of collective punishment she described in her controversial tweets about Bushehr. The wearing of underwear is mandatory for all prisoners, she wrote. But after one woman refused to wear a bra day and night all of her fellow inmates were forced to surrender their undergarments. ""At roll call, and in front of the horror-stricken eyes of the other female inmates,"" she wrote, the guards tore her clothes off. ""The inmates continued to pay for [the prisoner's] refusal. They lined everyone up and forced them to take their bras and underwear off and put them in a trash bag."" ""From that point on, wearing undergarments was prohibited for weeks, even when the women had their period,"" Gholian wrote. In another case, a woman who used a bottle of mineral water to shower when not allowed was taken to the prison yard, stripped naked, and doused with milk and mineral water in front of other inmates and guards. ""It is said that a woman's 'human dignity' must be preserved,"" Gholian told RFE/RL. ""But the same woman is stripped naked during roll call."" She said that a ""woman's human dignity is trampled on with all her being"" when stripped naked in front of others, and that while she has written hundreds of letters to the authorities, including Attorney-General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, about the incident, none has been answered. ""I have described all the issues in such a way that there is no need to talk to the prisoner at all,"" she said. ""I have mentioned the exact date of the incident so that they can go [check the security-camera footage] and see how the prisoner was stripped naked and bathed in mineral water and milk."" This is far from the first time Gholian has gone public with accounts of abusive treatment against her or other prisoners in Iran, which international rights watchdogs routinely criticize for its systemic use of torture, political repression, the execution of minors, and other crimes against humanity. Gholian was arrested along with about 20 activists, protest organizers, and workers during the Haft Tappeh Sugar Factory strike in November 2018. But while most were released on bond the next day, Gholian was imprisoned for a month. Her release from prison in Ahvaz was short-lived. After Iranian state television aired footage in January 2019, in which it purported to show Gholian confessing to taking part in alleged Western-backed efforts to overthrow the government, she promptly countered on social media by saying she had been beaten and forced to make a false confession. The next day, her father, Khodarahm Gholian, told RFE/RL that security forces arrived at the family home to take both Sepideh and her brother Mehdi away. Khodarahm Gholian said Sepideh and Mehdi were severely beaten before being thrown in a vehicle, and that the officers also beat him and his wife. He told RFE/RL that, upon his daughter's release the previous December, authorities warned they would ""burn her to ashes"" if she spoke out. Based on her alleged confession, she was sentenced to 18 years in prison, after which she was released on bail in October 2019 after going on a hunger strike that prompted Amnesty International to raise concerns. While out of custody, Gholian wrote a memoir about her time in Sepidar prison that was published by Iran Wire in July 2020. The personal account -- broken into 19 vignettes that describe discrimination against Arab inmates, forced shavings, rape, and other abuses -- has since been published as a book, Tilapia Sucks The Blood Of Hur al-Azim. Written by RFE/RL senior correspondent Michael Scollon, based on reporting by RFE/RL's Radio Farda and an interview conducted by Radio Farda senior correspondent Mohammad Zarghami."

He spoke to us about being the second participant in the world in a groundbreaking medical trial designed to try and restore vision to visually impaired patients. ""What I was seeing prior to the surgery last September, my central vision was very obscured,"" Kalberer said. ""It was probably the size varying between a Q-tip and dime."" Now his surgically-treated right eye no longer experiences an underwater sensation, he said. Also, the circumference of his vision in that eye is now closer to the size of a quarter. ""I've also started to see changes in light perception — things like silhouettes of objects like a fork or food on a plate and even color which was pretty cool,"" Kalberer said. The study he is part of involves the revolutionary gene-editing technique called CRISPR, which allows scientists to make precise changes in DNA. Kalberer, who lives on Long Island, reflected on one of the most impactful moments for him a few months back, when he was in the car with a friend. ""I said, 'I see pink,'"" she said. ""She's driving, she pulls over and says, 'Yeah, you see the sunset.'"" In studies done to date with CRISPR, doctors take cells out of the body, edit them in a lab and then infuse those edited cells back into patients. This is the first time scientists are using CRISPR to edit DNA still inside a patient's body. The retina, for instance, can't be removed because it's attached to the brain.

He shared videos with us of him picking up and drinking from a glass — something he couldn't do easily just last year. ""My visual field was so constricted that my muscles would tense up and they would tense up when I was trying not to spill it,"" Kalberer said. ""So visually, now that I recognize the glass as a glass, I can grab that easily because my eyes relax my brain.""

In return, the Taliban expects economic cooperation and humanitarian assistance from Islamabad and Beijing, and are lobbying for sanctions to be removed, security analysts believe. Separatist groups in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan have been alarmed by the increasing arrests of their members and sympathizers by the Taliban in the Afghan provinces of Nimroz and Kandahar and said that the detainees, whose whereabouts are unknown, could be handed over to Pakistani authorities. Mir Bakhtiar Domki, head of Baloch Republican Guard, one of banned militant groups, said in a statement that the arrests of several Baloch refugees, including senior leader Malik Khan Muhammad Marri, by the Taliban is a matter of concern. ""The Taliban should ensure the protection of Baloch refugees like a neighbor, instead of protecting the interests of Pakistan,"" said Domki, who is a former Balochistan provincial minister. Pakistani military first kicked off its operations against Baloch separatist groups in 2004, forcing a large number of insurgents and their families to flee across the border into Afghanistan. As the Taliban have long been hosting militants who fled from neighboring countries, there was uncertainty over whether the militants-turned new rulers of Afghanistan would keep allowing the foreign militants to stay. Among Pakistan-origin militants, Baloch separatists groups have typically been attacking Chinese interests, including projects linked with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Pakistan components of BRI infrastructure projects, worth over $50 billion. However, after taking control of Kabul in August, the Taliban has launched a crackdown on members and supporters of Baloch separatist groups. The Balochistan Post, a pro-militant, Urdu-language website, recently reported that Taliban insurgents in Kandahar have been forcing Baloch families to vacate their houses, and are commandeering their vehicles. A Taliban provincial official in Nimroz told Nikkei Asia under condition of anonymity that the regime has arrested people belonging to Baloch tribes in the province for their links with the Islamic State's regional affiliate for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- known as ISIS-K. ""Taliban leadership has also been ensuring that Afghan soil would not be used for subversive activities against any country,"" he said.

Some analysts, including Basir Ahmed Hotak, a Paris-based Afghan security expert, believe that in meetings with the Taliban, Islamabad and Beijing had offered economic cooperation on the condition that the Taliban cuts ties and takes action against the militant groups, such as various Baloch separatist groups, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, as ""these groups operate from their sanctuaries in Afghanistan and target Chinese investments,"" Hotak told Nikkei. On Aug. 20, the Baloch Liberation Army carried out a suicide bombing targeting a vehicle carrying Chinese nationals in Gwadar. Similarly, Islamabad and Beijing accused the TTP with ETIM's support of carrying out a July 14 suicide attack that killed nine Chinese engineers working on a hydroelectric project in Pakistan's Kohistan District. The Taliban's crackdown in Afghanistan has been forcing Baloch separatists to find new hideouts, such as in Iran's province of Sistan, which shares a border with Balochistan. A police officer in Balochistan on Sept. 28 claimed that three BLA members arrested in an intelligence-based raid in the bordering town of Kech revealed in interrogation that the Aug. 20 suicide attack on Chinese nationals was planned in Iran. ""Taliban are arresting and expelling the Baloch separatists to placate Pakistani fears of being attacked by these groups from Afghanistan, as witnessed in the past,"" Abdul Basit, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told Nikkei. However, the new rulers are unlikely to meet the demands of Islamabad and Beijing to flush out sanctuaries of the TTP and ETIM, which are part of an al-Qaeda-led larger Jihadi network that helped the Taliban to capture most of Afghanistan. ""Instead, the Taliban has been facilitating talks between Islamabad and the TTP leadership to resolve their dispute,"" said Basit. ""On the other hand, Taliban leaders have also recently moved the ETIM's Uyghur militants from Badakhshan province [in Afghanistan's northeast], which adjoins Xinjiang in China via the narrow Wakhan Corridor, to eastern and central parts of Afghanistan to address Chinese concerns.""

Because of the disruption to Afghan government revenue and aid, the regime cannot even meet basic expenses such as salaries of government employees. ""In return for their actions against Baloch separatists and removing Uyghur insurgents, the Taliban expect economic support, development cooperation and humanitarian assistance from Islamabad and Beijing, which Afghanistan directly needs at this juncture,"" Basit said. Islamabad and Beijing have been cautiously lobbying with the international community about lifting the economic sanctions against Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to help the new rulers run the country's affairs. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged his counterparts during a virtual meeting with G20 ministers on Sept. 23 to unfreeze Afghanistan's foreign assets and stop exerting ""political pressure"" on the Taliban. Beijing on Sept. 8 pledged $31 million in immediate aid to the Taliban government. Pakistan has also been offering technical support to the new interim Taliban administration in different sectors, including banking and commerce."

The Ocean Cleanup The Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit organization, aims to rid the world's oceans of plastic. It recently debuted a device it said collected 20,000 pounds from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. But some scientists worry the device still isn't effective or environmentally friendly enough. It's been nearly a decade since Boyan Slat announced at age 18 that he had a plan to rid the world's oceans of plastic. Slat, now 27, is a Dutch inventor and the founder of the Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit that aims to remove 90% of floating ocean plastic by 2040. That goal has often seemed unattainable. The Ocean Cleanup launched its first attempt at a plastic-catching device in 2018, but the prototype broke in the water. A newer model, released in 2019, did a better job of collecting plastic, but the organization estimated that it would need hundreds of those devices to clean the world's oceans. Video: What if we paved roads with plastic trash? Scientists and engineers began to question whether the group could deliver on the tens of millions of dollars it had acquired in funding. But over the summer, the organization pinned its hopes on a new device, which it nicknamed Jenny. The installation is essentially an artificial floating coastline that catches plastic in its fold like a giant arm, then funnels the garbage into a woven funnel-shaped net. Two vessels tow it through the water at about 1.5 knots (slower than normal walking speed), and the ocean current pushes floating garbage toward the giant net. In early August, the team launched Jenny in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a trash-filled vortex between Hawaii and California. The garbage patch is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world, encompassing more than 1.8 trillion pieces, according to the Ocean Cleanup's estimates. Last week, Jenny faced its final test as the organization sought to determine whether it could bring large amounts of plastic to shore without breaking or malfunctioning. The Ocean Cleanup said the device hauled 9,000 kilograms, or nearly 20,000 pounds, of trash out of the Pacific Ocean - proof that the garbage patch could eventually be cleaned up. Story continues ""Holy mother of god,"" Slat tweeted that afternoon, adding, ""It all worked!!!"" -The Ocean Cleanup (@TheOceanCleanup) October 11, 2021 How the new device works Slat's ocean-cleaning device has come a long way since the original prototype: a 330-foot-long floating barrier that resembled a long pipe in the water. The newest version is U-shaped and more flexible, like the lane dividers in a pool. Once its attached net fills with plastic (every few weeks or so), a crew hauls it up out of the water and empties the garbage onto one of the vessels that pull it. The Ocean Cleanup's new plastic-catching system, nicknamed Jenny, in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The Ocean Cleanup Once it's brought to shore, the plastic gets recycled. For now, the Ocean Cleanup is using the plastic to make $200 pairs of sunglasses, funneling the proceeds back into the cleanup efforts. Eventually, the organization hopes to partner with consumer brands to make more recycled products. Slat estimated that the team would need about 10 Jennys to clean up 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years. A single device can hold 10,000 to 15,000 kilograms of plastic, he tweeted. Concerns about the ocean-cleaning device linger Plastic accumulating in a net, or ""retention zone."" The Ocean Cleanup The Ocean Cleanup system collects several types of floating garbage, including large containers, fishing nets, and microplastics just a few millimeters in size. But it captures only plastic floating near the ocean's surface. A study published last year suggested that there may be upwards of 30 times as much plastic at the bottom of the ocean as there is near the surface. The organization says large pieces of floating plastic will ultimately degrade into microplastics that are much harder to clean up. The Jenny device, of course, doesn't prevent plastic from entering oceans to begin with. Researchers have estimated that about 11 million metric tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. By 2040, that figure could rise to 29 million metric tons. Ten Jenny devices would be able to collect 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons a year, according to the Ocean Cleanup. An Ocean Cleanup member sorting plastic on one of the team's support vessels. The Ocean Cleanup What's more, the boats that pull the Jenny device require fuel, meaning there's an environmental cost. The device was originally designed to passively collect plastic using the ocean's current, but that design led to it spilling too much of the trash it had collected. The Ocean Cleanup says it's purchasing carbon credits to offset the towing vessels' emissions. ""Once plastic has gotten into the open ocean, it becomes very expensive and fossil-fuel intensive to get it back out again,"" Miriam Goldstein, the director of ocean policy at the think tank Center for American Progress, told Reuters last month. But Slat tweeted on Saturday that there's still time to address those concerns. ""Lots of things still to iron out,"" he wrote of his group's plastic-cleaning work, ""but one thing we now know: deploy a small fleet of these systems, and one *can* clean it up.""

The announcement from the RMT union came alongside a ballot confirming strike action from refuse workers in Glasgow should they not receive an improved pay offer next week. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... It is a nightmare scenario for the First Minister who is set to welcome world leaders including US President Joe Biden who also confirmed his presence at COP26 today. COP26: Rail workers will go on strike in Scotland during the Cop26 global climate conference Opposition politicians labelled the strike action a “major embarrassment” and accused the SNP of allowing COP26 to fall into “sheer chaos”. Following the ballot, ScotRail workers are set to strike from November 1 to 12 amid a dispute over pay and conditions, with an improved pay deal put on the table by the train operator earlier this week. It is understood an offer of an initial 2.5 per cent backdated to April this year, with an additional 2.2 per cent promised in April 2022, had been made. Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government’s transport agency, said it expects this pay deal to be put to a ballot of RMT members again ahead of COP26. More than 10,000 UK officers are expected to arrive in Glasgow in the days leading up to COP26, while around 2,500 Scottish officers are receiving extra training in how to manage large protests Such a strike would see the railway network crippled and unable to operate, similar to the near wipeout of ScotRail’s Sunday services connected to a different dispute between workers and the operator. RMT members on the Caledonian Sleeper service, which is run by Serco, will also strike from October 31 to November 2 and from November 11 to 13. The union’s general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""Both ScotRail and the Caledonian Sleeper have had adequate time to come up with a fair pay settlement for Scotland's rail workers in advance of Cop26. ""Instead they have kicked the can down the road and left us with no option but to put this action on today. ""We know that these strikes will close rail services in Scotland but the blame for that lies with Abellio, Serco and the political leadership at Holyrood. ""It's time for all parties to take their rail workers seriously, get back round the table and give these staff at the front line of our green transport services the justice, respect and reward they deserve. "" The union had earlier announced the result of a ballot in which 84 per cent of more than 2,000 members backed more strikes over the ScotRail dispute. Concurrently, members of GMB in Glasgow voted in favour of industrial action during the summit, with 96.9 per cent backing a strike if an improved pay offer for refuse workers is not forthcoming from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). Chris Mitchell, of GMB, called on the Scottish Government and Cosla to take more action. Speaking with members of Glasgow’s Bridgeton and Queenslie depots gathered behind him, he said: “We have a clear message to the Scottish Government and Cosla. We were called Covid heroes and essential workers. “This is when low-paid workers take a stand against Cosla and say enough is enough, because these heroes here deserve a pay rise. Stand with us, not against us.” Strike action threatened by rail engineers represented by the Unite union was put on hold after a new offer was put forward, with that ballot closing on October 25. The union had said it would strike for several days during COP26. Nicola Sturgeon faced criticism for “inaction” following the announcement by RMT, with the Scottish Conservatives saying it had caused “misery” for months. The party’s transport spokesperson, Graham Simpson, said: “This is a major embarrassment for the SNP. Ministers should have resolved this dispute months ago. “The SNP’s inaction has meant misery for passengers who have had to endure major disruption to services throughout this year. “The eyes of the world are set to be on Glasgow in a matter of weeks. World leaders and delegates arriving in the city to take action to tackle the climate emergency will be greeted by rail services that have ground to a halt. “SNP Ministers must urgently redouble their efforts and work with all parties to find a solution once and for all. These strikes are now threatening to cast a shadow over COP26.” Neil Bibby, Scottish Labour’s transport spokesperson, echoed the criticism. He said: “COP26 is falling into sheer chaos as the SNP’s industrial relations collapse. “It is an embarrassment to Scotland that the SNP can’t even keep the trains running when the world’s eyes are upon us. “This conference is supposed to be about preventing environmental catastrophe – and the SNP are setting the stage by letting trains grind to a halt and litter fill the streets. “Rail workers were on the front line right through the pandemic and the way they have been treated in return is disgraceful. “The SNP must intervene to deliver a fair pay deal before their contempt for workers brings COP26 to its knees.” Responding to the strike action announcement, a ScotRail spokesperson said: “It’s extremely disappointing that the RMT have opted to continue with this highly damaging strike action, particularly when a pay offer, negotiated over several weeks, has been made to the trade unions. “We’re seeing customers gradually return to Scotland’s Railway, but the scale of the financial situation ScotRail is facing is stark. “To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change. All of us in the railway – management, staff, trade unions, suppliers, and government – need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.” A Transport Scotland spokesperson added: “We welcome the constructive talks which have taken place between all parties. “A significant offer has been made by employers since this RMT ballot opened and we understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer. “We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action. “Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland’s Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26.” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week that she hoped the dispute could be resolved before Cop26. She said: ""I would strongly encourage both sides of this dispute to get back round the table and find a resolution that is in the interests of those who work in our railways."" Kathryn Darbandi, Managing Director for Serco Caledonian Sleeper, said: “We are deeply disappointed and frustrated that the RMT is taking further industrial action. “This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for everyone in Scotland’s railway. Unprecedented levels of government investment into Caledonian Sleeper - and the rail industry more widely - since the start of the pandemic have helped us to protect 100% of jobs and ensure all staff received full pay, even though our services were significantly reduced. “We have repeatedly tabled realistic and reasonable offers which we believe should have ended the dispute. Industrial action during COP26 - when the eyes of the world will be on Scotland - risks both the reputation of rail as an environmentally friendly and sustainable mode of transport, but also the great progress the entire team at Caledonian Sleeper have made in building back the confidence of our guests. ""The RMT’s action does not reflect the reality of the financial situation facing all parties in Scotland’s railway today, as we seek to rebuild the industry for the future. We need to work together, and we continue to be open to realistic discussions.” A message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this article.

(Photo: Arif Ali/AFP) Religious minorities in Pakistan suffered a major setback with a parliamentary committee rejecting an anti-forced conversion bill on Oct. 13. Lawmakers from minority communities protested the decision and a heated exchange ensued between parliamentarians of opposing views after the Committee to Protect Minorities from Forced Conversions disposed off the draft bill citing public interest. “We are serious about [addressing] the problem of forced conversions. The law on the subject, however, was to be formed to address the issue and not for getting appreciation from an international organization or an NGO,” said Ali Muhammad Khan, the junior federal minister for parliamentary affairs. The bill, which proposed legalities for only “mature” non-Muslims to convert to Islam, was previously termed un-Islamic by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony. National Assembly member Ramesh Kumar Vankwani recalled the fierce opposition from Muslim parliamentarians. “There was so much pressure that Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari had to leave saying that it wasn’t her bill. Even hardliner parliamentarians agree on the issue of forced conversions but argue that it is not that big [an issue]. What is this?” he asked. All this is being carried out in an environment of impunity. This has to stop and it is up to the state to take urgent and necessary action “In my 20 years of parliamentary life, I have never experienced this kind of situation. The good image created by the Supreme Court and the prime minister on the rehabilitation of temples has been tarnished.” Jaipal Chhabria, a Hindu member of Pakistan’s National Commission for Minorities, warned of protests. “We will not sit silently.

The projection was seen on the Synagogue of Malmö and on other buildings in cities across southern Sweden on Wednesday night, the day of the Malmö International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism. Police are handling the case as a hate crime, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported. The Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi group, claimed responsibility for the incident, according to Dagens Nyheter. The conference had brought together heads of state and other prominent government officials from dozens of countries in a city known for its high rates of antisemitism.

Then-mayor Ilmar Reepalu reacted by instructing the local Jewish community to distance itself from Israel, giving many the impression that he was blaming the victims. The Jewish community in Sweden’s third-largest city has since dwindled down to around 500. Despite Wednesday’s synagogue incident, Katharina von Schnurbein, the European Commission’s coordinator on combating antisemitism, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on Friday that she thinks the conference shows that “change is possible.” Advertisement “The fact that the conference happened in Malmö sends a message, that this sort of thing will not be accepted and will be confronted,” von Schnurbein said. At the conference, she presented a new strategic plan for combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life in Europe, published by the European Commission on October 5. Although the plan does not include a budget, von Schurbein said, “its different components will receive millions of euros in funding in the coming period.” Among the goals of the plan is to set up a cross-European methodology for documenting and reporting antisemitic hate crimes. On Tuesday, Jewish community leaders at a separate conference in Brussels complained that the EU plan was “not serious” because it does not address two issues that have alienated local Jews for years: bans on the ritual slaughter of animals and attempts to ban non-medical circumcision. Von Schurbein said the plan does reference the ritual slaughter issue, by calling on members states to find “a fair balance between respect for the freedom to manifest religion and the protection of animal welfare.” The EU Commission and her office intend to facilitate efforts to strike the balance, von Schnurbein said, “but when it comes to the document, the Commission is bound to the ruling of the European Court,” which in 2020 upheld the rights of states in Belgium to ban ritual slaughter."

The national coronavirus task force on Saturday reported 1,002 deaths in the previous day, up from 999 on Friday, along with 33,208 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, more than 1,000 higher than the day before. Authorities have tried to speed up the pace of vaccination with lotteries, bonuses and other incentives, but widespread vaccine skepticism and conflicting signals from officials stymied the efforts. The government said this week that about 43 million Russians, or about 29 per cent of the country's nearly 146 million people, are fully vaccinated. Despite the mounting toll, the Kremlin has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown like the one early on in the pandemic that badly hurt the economy, eroding President Vladimir Putin's popularity. Instead, it has delegated the power to enforce coronavirus restrictions to regional authorities. Some of Russia's 85 regions have restricted attendance at large public events and limited access to theaters, restaurants and other venues. However, daily life is going on largely as normal in Moscow, St. Petersburg and many other Russian cities, with businesses operating as usual and mask mandates loosely enforced. Health Minister Mikhail Murashko acknowledged this week that medical facilities have come under growing strain and said that authorities have offered retired medics who have gotten vaccinated the option of returning to work. Overall, the coronavirus task force has registered more than 7,958,000 confirmed cases and 222,315 deaths -- Europe's highest death toll. The official record ranks Russia as having the fifth-most pandemic deaths in the world following the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. However, state statistics agency Rosstat, which also counts deaths in which the virus wasn't considered the main cause, has reported a much higher pandemic death toll -- about 418,000 people with COVID-19 as of August. Based on that higher number, Russia would rank be the fourth hardest-hit nation in the world, ahead of Mexico."

The UAE considers drug dealing a serious crime and is known to have a “zero-tolerance approach”. Billy Hood, 25, was arrested in the Emirates on February 2 and charged with drug trafficking after his car was searched and substantial amounts of cannabis oil were found. The General Directorate for Drug Control (GDDC) received a tip-off that Mr Hood possessed quantities of synthetic cannabis oil with the intention of selling, according to a statement from the UAE’s Public Prosecution. A source from the GDDC said that the man “had quantities of cannabis oil intended for trafficking in return for financial gain”, including the cannabis oil, substantial amounts of cash, an electronic hookah, various storage bottles and boxes and 570 individual cartridges to be used for substance vaping. The statement said Mr Hood was convicted “based on evidence including the items found in his possession, information on his phone, a third-party statement and his own confession”. “Mr Hood has since appealed the initial ruling in accordance with UAE law, and his case is now pending with the Court of Appeal. At all times, he has been treated in accordance with UAE law and applicable international standards”, according to an official statement from the UAE Public Prosecution. There were reports in British media in which Mr Hood alleged that he was not treated well and was forced to sign a confession written in Arabic despite not speaking the language. The public prosecution office said that Mr Hood has had access to an English interpreter at all stages, including for his questioning, confession and trial. “He was represented in his trial by a defence lawyer whom he selected. The UAE provided full access to Mr Hood for UK diplomatic and consular representatives, who visited him in custody,” the statement read. “The UAE Government considers that drug dealing is a serious crime. Like a number of other governments, it takes a zero-tolerance approach, and this is well known. It seeks to protect its communities from the serious dangers posed by illicit narcotics.” The UN Office of Drugs and Crime has categorised MDMB-4en-PINACA - the cannabis oil that was found in Mr Hood’s car - as a Schedule II substance, with severe adverse health effects and fatal intoxication, which has no therapeutic use. According to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, MDMB-4en-PINACA was placed under international control at the 64th regular session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in April 2021 (Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971) upon recommendation by the World Health Organisation. The substance is a potent synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist - with similar effects to a number of other synthetic cannabinoids that are controlled under Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. The use of MDMB-4en-PINACA has been associated with severe adverse effects, including fatal intoxications, and cases of impaired driving. MDMB-4en-PINACA has no therapeutic use, according to WHO."

The space probe, dubbed Lucy and packed inside a special cargo capsule, lifted off on schedule from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 5:34 a.m. EDT (0934 GMT), NASA said. It was carried aloft by an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance (UAL), a joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Lucy's mission is a 12-year expedition to study a record number of asteroids. It will be the first to explore the Trojans, thousands of rocky objects orbiting the sun in two swarms - one ahead of the path of giant gas planet Jupiter and one behind it. The largest known Trojan asteroids, named for the warriors of Greek mythology, are believed to measure as much as 225 kilometers (140 miles) in diameter. Scientists hope Lucy's close-up fly-by of seven Trojans will yield new clues to how the solar system's planets came to be formed some 4.5 billion years ago and what shaped their present configuration. 1/5 NASA's Lucy spacecraft, atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket for a mission to study the Trojan asteroids in the outer solar system, launches from Pad-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S. October 16, 2021.

""The Trojan asteroids are leftovers from the early days of our solar system, effectively the fossils of planet formation,"" principal mission investigator Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was quoted by NASA as saying. No other single science mission has been designed to visit as many different objects independently orbiting the sun in the history of space exploration, NASA said. As well as the Trojans, Lucy will do a fly-by of an asteroid in the solar system's main asteroid belt, called DonaldJohanson in honor of the lead discoverer of the fossilized human ancestor known as Lucy, from which the NASA mission takes its name. The Lucy fossil, unearthed in Ethiopia in 1974, was in turn named for the Beatles hit ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."" Lucy the asteroid probe will make spaceflight history in another way. Following a route that circles back to Earth three times for gravitational assists, it will be the first spacecraft ever to return to Earth's vicinity from the outer solar system, according to NASA. The probe will use rocket thrusters to maneuver in space and two rounded solar arrays, each the width of a school bus, to recharge batteries that will power the instruments contained in the much smaller central body of the spacecraft.

The Australian trade minister had hoped to clinch an agreement with his U.K. counterpart Anne-Marie Trevelyan at the end of his long, multi-stop trip across the globe, but the two sides ended up kicking the can. “I know we're all impatient to get that signature on the final inked deal,” Tehan told the U.K.-Australia Chamber of Commerce at a breakfast event on Friday, the morning after his meeting with Trevelyan. “I can tell you no one is more impatient than me to get that done. But we do have to make sure that we get it right.” The two sides reached an “agreement in principle” in June, but have spent months wrangling over the legal text. Converting a 16-page draft agreement into a fully scrubbed tome both sides can sign up to has turned out to be more of a challenge than was hoped. There are 32 chapters in the agreement, plus four annexes with multiple sub-sections and nine side letters. By the end of Tehan's visit, 29 of those chapters had their legal text finalized, with three to go. The Australian version of the deal stands at around 1,600 pages, while the U.K. text is 2,600. “I'm not quite sure whether it's just the type spacing or the different sides of the schedule,"" Tehan quipped, ""but they've got a few more pages than us."" “Obviously we've got to dot i's and cross t's and the final negotiations do take time,” he added, saying he hoped the deal was “not very far away at all.” The visit was an emotional rollercoaster for U.K. officials hoping to get the agreement over the line. One person said the two sides were “working and progressing” through the day despite the lack of closure. As the moment seemed to slip away, there was still hope of a surprise last-minute concession — but as the afternoon drew on, it became clear the deal wasn't going to happen. Hopes had been raised the previous week by George Brandis, the Australian high commissioner to the U.K., who made clear to the Conservative Party conference the visit was the prime moment to finalize negotiations. “We hope that the last outstanding issues will be nailed down then when [Tehan] has the first face-to-face meeting with the new trade secretary,” he told a fringe event at the Manchester conference. Industry insiders with an ear into the negotiations told POLITICO the two sides were still working through tariff rates for different cuts of meat, as well as other political differences. The aim is to get the deal into force during summer 2022. One person at the event Tehan spoke at said some eyebrows were raised when he said he hoped to build on migration agreements in the deal, one of which will see people under the age of 35 able to get working visas more easily. He said he wanted migration to be “free-flowing” between the two nations, and as good a deal as the U.K. had with the EU. This article is part of POLITICO’s premium policy service Pro Trade.

Renan Calheiros said during a radio interview that the investigation launched in April has collected evidence to show that Bolsonaro should be formally charged with genocide against the country's indigenous population, malfeasance, irregular use of public funds, violation of sanitary measures, incitement to crime and forgery of private documents, among other crimes. The far-right president, who himself was infected with the coronavirus in July 2020, has railed against lockdown measures, pushed unproven cures, sowed vaccine doubts and downplayed the severity of COVID-19. The report is scheduled to be released by the Senate investigative panel next Tuesday. The panel's members the following day are set to vote on approving the text before sending it on the attorney general's office on Thursday to decide if Bolsonaro and others should be charged. The attorney general's office can charge the president, but the Supreme Court, which would try him, must request authorization from the lower house to proceed. Experts say the lower house is highly unlikely to sign off on such a request. The president's office did not immediately respond to request for comment. Bolsonaro's approval ratings have fallen in public opinion polls over his handling of the public health crisis. More than 600,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.

The Russian space agency said in a statement on its website that the crew and station were never in any danger. But it was the second such emergency on the station since July, when an unexpected firing of thrusters on a new Russian module briefly inverted the outpost. The incident occurred on Friday morning as the Russian astronaut Oleg Novitsky was performing a test of the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, a crew module that has been docked to the station since April. The spacecraft is scheduled to return three passengers to Earth on Sunday. When the engine test was scheduled to end, “the thruster firing unexpectedly continued,” Leah Cheshier, a NASA spokeswoman, said in an email, and the station orbital positioning control was lost at 5:13 a.m. Eastern time. Russian officials in Moscow and personnel at NASA’s astronaut headquarters in Houston sprang into action during the incident, voicing commands to their astronauts to initiate emergency protocols."

The 2G rule refers to public places being given the option to allow entry only to vaccinated (geimpft in German) or people who’ve recovered from Covid (genesen). and has so far been allowed in half of Germany’s states for certain public places like bars, restaurants, nightclubs and cinemas. The government in Hesse said that it had taken the decision to go a step further and allow shops to bar entry to the unvaccinated “at the request of the sector”. (article continues below) See also on The Local: Implementing 2G rules allows shops to drop mask-wearing and social distancing rules. “We expect that this option will only be used on some days and that businesses which cater to everyday needs will not make use of it,” state leader Volker Bouffier said on Tuesday. The decision comes after a Frankfurt court ruled in favour of a barbecue utensil store which had launched a legal objection to the fact that it could not implement 2G rules on its premises. The court said in its ruling earlier in October that it had “considerable legal reservations about the exclusion of sales outlets and similar establishments from the so-called 2G rule”. READ MORE: Should retailers in Germany be allowed to exclude unvaccinated people from entry? 2G has proved controversial, with many people complaining that it excludes people who can’t vaccinated and that it has the potential to widen societal divisions over the pandemic response. Many locations in the hospitality and entertainment sector have stuck to a 3G rule, which allows people to enter if they can show a negative Covid-19 test. Throughout the pandemic, German authorities have excluded supermarkets and other grocers from most restrictions, such as lockdowns and entry rules, in order to ensure that everyone has continued access to essential goods. With several million German adults still to be vaccinated as the winter draws near, authorities have sought to up the pressure on them by making access to some parts of public life more difficult or costly. Eight federal states have allowed businesses and event organisers to adopt the so-called 2G option – that is to allow entry only to the vaccinated (geimpft) and people who’ve recovered from Covid-19 (genesen) – and not unvaccinated people who’ve tested (getestet) negatively for Covid. Nationwide, the negative lateral flow test that is necessary to be allowed entry as an unvaccinated person is no longer free. The government has said that this decision was taken in order to reduce the tax burden of pandemic measures. The Local approached the Hesse government for comment.

REUTERS/Adriano Machado RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A Brazilian Senate probe into the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic will recommend in its final report due next week that President Jair Bolsonaro face 11 criminal charges, the senator leading the inquiry said on Friday, though it remains highly unlikely that he will face a trial on any such charges. Renan Calheiros said during a radio interview that the investigation launched in April has collected evidence to show that Bolsonaro should be formally charged with genocide against the country's indigenous population, malfeasance, irregular use of public funds, violation of sanitary measures, incitement to crime and forgery of private documents, among other crimes. The far-right president, who himself was infected with the coronavirus in July 2020, has railed against lockdown measures, pushed unproven cures, sowed vaccine doubts and downplayed the severity of COVID-19. The report is scheduled to be released by the Senate investigative panel next Tuesday. The panel's members the following day are set to vote on approving the text before sending it on the attorney general's office on Thursday to decide if Bolsonaro and others should be charged. The attorney general's office can charge the president, but the Supreme Court, which would try him, must request authorization from the lower house to proceed. Experts say the lower house is highly unlikely to sign off on such a request. The president's office did not immediately respond to request for comment. Bolsonaro's approval ratings have fallen in public opinion polls over his handling of the public health crisis. More than 600,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.

It's a war ""between brothers, between sisters,"" Tamu said. A war that, as far as he can tell, has done nothing for his country. That stage in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa was where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sat last week as he watched a procession of military bands, having just been elected to a second five-year term last week. Behind him, written in large letters was a message: ""A new beginning."" ""I hope this new beginning brings peace,"" said another local, Hatalesh Gabesa, as she looked at the sign on her way home from church. ""Peace is more important than everything else."" Ethiopia's civil war is a conflict between the country's new rulers and its old ones, who were based in the Tigray region in the north. That's where the war started, but it has now expanded south and east to neighboring states, displacing millions of Ethiopians. While there is no official death toll, some estimates put the number of dead in the tens of thousands. The government has instituted a blockade around the areas controlled by Tigrayan rebels, which has meant cutting off the region to most humanitarian aid, medical supplies and fuel. It's a growing humanitarian crisis that is steadily gaining more international attention — including from a whistleblower who addressed a U.S. senate committee hearing last Tuesday. Enlarge this image toggle caption Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images Facebook accused of 'fanning ethnic violence' in Ethiopian civil war Frances Haugen, a former data scientist at Facebook, told members of a Senate subcommittee that her former employer bears some of the blame for the growing conflict in Ethiopia. More than once, Haugen accused Facebook's algorithms of ""literally fanning ethnic violence"" in Ethiopia. ""My fear is that without action, divisive and extremist behaviors we see today are only the beginning,"" Haugen said. ""What we saw in Myanmar and are now seeing in Ethiopia are only the beginning chapters of a story so terrifying no one wants to read the end of it."" Freelance journalist Zecharias Zelalem is one of the people attempting to document that story in real time. He reports extensively on Ethiopia and agrees with Haugen's assessment. ""Just looking at the instances of documented evidence over the course of the past three years in which prominent Facebook posters would post unverified, often inflammatory posts or rhetoric that would then go on to incite mob violence, ethnic clashes, crackdowns on independent press or outspoken voices,"" Zelalem said. In one recent instance, Zelalem saw an inflammatory Facebook post from a media outlet that falsely blamed members of an ethnic minority group for carrying out murders and kidnappings that took place on Sept. 27. The post quickly got hundreds of shares and likes. A day later, on Sept. 28, Zelalem said the village cited in the post was ransacked, burnt to the ground and the inhabitants were murdered. ""Despite multiple efforts to report the post, it remains up and live as of this moment,"" he said. Facebook says Ethiopia is a 'company priority' In Ethiopia, these are old ethnic tensions that are being stoked in new ways. As more pro-government and anti-Tigrayan rhetoric circulates online, Zelalem worries it is normalizing the violence the country has seen over the past year. Facebook denies allegations that its platform has helped sow violence. A spokesperson sent NPR a statement saying that Ethiopia was a ""company priority,"" and that Facebook had added content reviewers in several local languages. The statement said Facebook had ""worked to improve our proactive detection so that we can remove more harmful content at scale."" Zelalem isn't buying it. ""I can quite honestly say that Facebook has — if it has done anything, it's not nearly enough, at least, because there have been more than enough documented incidents,"" he said. In the meantime, the crisis in Ethiopia is worsening. The international community has been pushing the country to allow more aid into the rebel-held regions, but that hasn't worked. The U.S. has threatened sanctions. And humanitarian groups say the country is still on a path toward famine. The Ethiopian government, as it continues its social media messaging campaign, says the international community is exaggerating the crisis. A version of this story ran on NPR's daily news magazine All Things Considered."

The 2019 movie, starring the British actor James Norton and directed by the Polish film-maker Agnieszka Holland, depicts the real-life story of Gareth Jones, a Welshman who is widely considered to have been the first journalist to document the famine, after repeated visits to the Soviet Union. In footage posted online on Thursday evening, about 30 people are seen entering the office of Memorial, Russia’s oldest NGO, which documents Soviet-era repressions. The men are heard shouting “shame” and ordering viewers to leave because “the screening is over”. Irina Sherbakova, Memorial’s lawyer, said that after the police were called, the authorities handcuffed the entrance doors to Memorial’s office and locked its staff and attenders inside for hours. “It was strange, the police started to question us and not the ones who actually disrupted the movie. This looks like a planned attack on us to scare us away, approved by the authorities,” she said. Nationalist activists frequently disrupt liberal, feminist and LGBT events, and Kremlin critics say the activists are able to freely operate with tacit approval from the authorities. “This isn’t the first and it won’t be the last attack on us,” Sherbakova said. Memorial, which also speaks out about present-day human rights violations in Russia, has found itself under growing pressure from the authorities in recent years. In 2015 it was one of the first organisations to be labelled as a “foreign agent” under a 2012 law that obliges groups considered to have international funding to submit extensive documents every three months outlining their finances. The screening of Mr Jones comes at a time when a growing number of Russians view Stalin in a favourable light. In a poll in May by the independent Levada Center, 56% of respondents agreed with the statement that the Soviet dictator was a “great leader” – double the number in 2016. Scholars believe between 4 million and 7 million people perished during the famine, which was partly triggered by Soviet-led mass collectivisation. Ukraine has labelled the Holodomor as a genocide, an assertion rejected by the Kremlin, and interpretations of the famine’s causes have caused friction between the two countries."

Russia’s independent Levada Center pollster said 69% of respondents disagreed with the statement that “adults have the right to enter into same-sex relationships by mutual consent.” That share has grown from 60% in 2013, when Russia adopted its controversial “gay propaganda” law that banned promotion of homosexuality among minors. LGBT activists criticized the law for further marginalizing minority groups across the country and stifling their freedoms in favor of promoting conservative “traditional values” that Russia’s leaders say are at odds with liberal Western attitudes. The Levada survey showed an increasing split in how Russian society views same-sex relationships, with those in support increasing slightly from 23% in 2013 to 25%. The proportion who said they were undecided declined from 17% to 7%, following years in which the issue of LGBT rights has become a prominent part of the government’s anti-Western messaging on state television. “In other words, public opinion on this issue has grown more polarized than ever,” Levada said. Respondents aged 18-24 expressed the most support for same-sex couples, with 53% backing adults’ right to enter into a same-sex relationship. Some 39% held the opposing view. As the age of respondents’ increased, support for same-sex couples declined and opposition increased markedly. Asked about their personal views of gay people, more respondents expressed “disgust” and “fear” (38%) than in 2013 (26%), Levada said. At the same time, the share of those who viewed people who identify as homosexual in a neutral light has grown from 23% to 32% over the same period."

The company reportedly removed the app at the request of government officials, a somewhat surprising move given Islam is a protected religion in the People’s Republic of China. Quran Majeed is available for free and “recognized by 25 million Muslim users around the world” according to the app’s developer Pakistan Data Management Services. The app’s removal apparently had nothing to do with its religious content, “according to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal,” the developer told the BBC. The developer says it’s now attempting to resolve the issue with China’s Cyberspace Administration. The Verge has reached out to both Apple and China’s US Embassy for comment. Without clearer explanation, the move seems like a possible overreach, though it does fall within Apple’s official stance on human rights abroad (PDF): We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward. With dialogue, and a belief in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our users—their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and helpful technology. While it’s logical for business, that framing has placed the company in questionable positions before. Apple has removed VPN apps that allowed Chinese users to avoid censorship and proactively filtered out apps that mentioned Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama, or Taiwanese and Tibetan independence. Apple’s suppliers in the region have also been connected to the oppression of China’s predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority. Apple is in a difficult situation either way. It relies on the business relationships and sales it makes in China. Taking a strong stance against the government could put that in jeopardy. Just this week, Microsoft made the decision to shut down the local Chinese version of LinkedIn, acknowledging separately that it is becoming increasingly difficult to comply with the Chinese government’s demands. Apple hasn’t yet found that line for itself, and with how much it relies on China to make its iPhone business work, it might not happen anytime soon."

She made the remarks, which were picked up on a livestream, at the opening of the Welsh parliament in Cardiff on Thursday. During a conversation with the Duchess of Cornwall and Elin Jones, the parliament’s presiding officer, the Queen referred to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow starting on 31 October, which she is scheduled to attend along with other members of the royal family. She said: “Extraordinary isn’t it. I’ve been hearing all about Cop ... still don’t know who is coming. No idea. “We only know about people who are not coming ... It’s really irritating when they talk, but they don’t do.” Jones replied: “Exactly. It’s a time for doing ... and watching your grandson [Prince William] on the television this morning saying there’s no point going to space, we need to save the Earth.” The Queen then smiled and said: “Yes, I read about it.” Prince William had condemned billionaires such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos for pioneering space tourism instead of focusing on the environmental problems on Earth. “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live.” The Duke of Cambridge also expressed his indignation at the inaction on tackling the climate crisis earlier this week and raised his concerns about the Cop26 climate conference. He told the BBC: “I think for Cop to communicate very clearly and very honestly what the problems are and what the solutions are going to be is critical. “We can’t have more clever speak, clever words but not enough action.” Among the world leaders still not confirmed to attend the UN’s Cop26 conference are Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, Chinese president Xi Jinping, Russian leader Vladimir Putin, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. US president Joe Biden has confirmed that he will attend. The Queen’s remarks mirror comments made by her son the Prince of Wales in an interview with the BBC earlier this week. Prince Charles said he was worried that world leaders would “just talk” when they meet in Glasgow. “The problem is to get action on the ground,” he said. The Prince of Wales also expressed surprise that Morrison had yet to confirm his attendance and believes that the summit in Glasgow is the “last chance saloon” for global action on the climate breakdown."

It says that non-state capital cannot invest in establishing and operating news organizations, which include news agencies, newspaper, magazine publishers, radio and TV broadcasters, radio and TV stations and web media publishers. NDRC also said that the non-public capital cannot introduce news published by organizations outside China. Moreover, they cannot host forums, summits or awards in journalism and the public opinion space, as per the reliable source. This looks like an attempt to reassert domestic discourse and shift as much dependence on state-owned media as possible. News outlets such as Caixin, Guancha which are perceived to be private non-state media are also heavily invested in by state-owned enterprises, so they won't be coming in the ""non-state capital"" category. If this draft becomes official regulation, it won't leave space for private capital media. This news was discussed by Weibo users and the talk of going back to the era of the Cultural Revolution again surfaced in Chinese social media, the reliable source added. Jianli Yang, writing in The Washington Times said that the echoes of the Cultural Revolution are reverberating throughout China today, with the Chinese government harking back to the past and placing curbs on many aspects of ideology and culture. President Xi Jinping's efforts to shape the minds of Chinese youth and control Chinese culture have begun to resemble the tactics employed by Mao Zedong, reported The Washington Times. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) approach towards dealing with society--particularly the business and entertainment industries--is aimed at regulating aspects that it considers detrimental to its larger goals and is likely to have a lasting impact on Chinese society, just as the Cultural Revolution did in the 1960s.

FILE PHOTO: People cast their ballots during the parliamentary elections in Lovosice, Czech Republic, October 8, 2021. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo The communists jailed tens of thousands in forced labor camps in the 1950s and brutally repressed dissidents such as playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel, but remained in parliament following the revolution. In this week's election here, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia took 3.62% of the votes with nearly all precincts reporting, less than the 5% needed to enter parliament and potentially marking a final chapter for a party that has gradually shrunk as its ageing membership dwindled. “It pleases me, it pleases me a lot,” Jiri Gruntorad, 69, a former dissident who signed the dissident Charter 77 statement and was jailed for subversion from 1981 to 1985 by the communist authorities, told Reuters. “But it’s coming too late.” “It was one of the last communist parties in the world apart from the Chinese and Cuban ones that held on to its name. The others have at least renamed themselves and started behaving a little differently.” Voters also handed a defeat to Prime Minister Andrej Babis’ ANO party against centre-right opposition group Together in a surprise result. After 1989, the communists sought to appeal to senior citizens and working class Czechs but they never resonated with younger voters and failed to shake the party’s history with others as a totalitarian rulers who had stifled freedom. “I am very disappointed because it is a really big failure,” said Communist Party leader Vojtech Filip, who also resigned. POST-1989 Havel opposed banning the party -- which resisted the country’s European Union and NATO membership and kept warm ties with Russia and China -- despite calls from the public to do so. The communists lingered mostly in isolation after 1989, though they cooperated with other parties seeking votes to pass legislation in parliament. They were also close to current President Milos Zeman.

Sailors in all navies are used to austere conditions, but there are certain things — especially in the Royal Navy — that are simply sacrosanct. Things like tea — that steaming amber liquid that steadies frayed British nerves and takes the chill out of almost any wet, weary bone on watch. The flag officer's mess aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth, the United Kingdom's newest aircraft carrier, suffered a shortage of tea while at sea in the Pacific over the past week. The crisis of morale was averted thanks to the quick-thinking commander of HMCS Winnipeg and with the likely assistance of one of his stewards. The commander of the British carrier task force paid a 90-minute visit to the Canadian patrol frigate recently — a routine check-in with one of the allied escorts. HMCS Winnipeg and HMS Queen Elizabeth both took part in a massive allied naval exercise off Japan last weekend. ""I went across thinking I would be offered traditional Canadian hospitality, whatever that may be,"" Commodore Steve Moorhouse told CBC News this week. ""And they very, very kindly laid on English tea, afternoon tea."" Whether he was expecting something a little stronger than tea is unclear.

The commander of the Winnipeg said it was the least they could do to help an allied unit suffering through the privation of a long sea voyage.

Kurz said he would move to parliament as leader of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg will replace him as chancellor, he said. ""My country is more important to me than myself,"" Kurz said in a televised statement. ""What we need now are stable conditions,'' he told reporters in Vienna. ""So, in order to resolve the stalemate, I want to make way to prevent chaos and ensure stability."" What are the allegations against him? Earlier this week, Austrian prosecutors said the chancellor and nine other individuals were being probed for bribery after investigators carried out raids on the offices of his ruling party. Though the ÖVP backed him against the allegations, the junior coalition partner, the Greens, demanded his resignation on Friday. Vice-Chancellor and Greens leader Werner Kogler argued that Kurz was ""no longer fit for office"" and called on the ÖVP to nominate an ""irreproachable person"" to replace him. Kurz and his associates are accused of using public funds from the Finance Ministry to ""finance partially manipulated opinion polls that served an exclusively party political interest"" between 2016 and 2018. Watch video 03:19 What is behind Sebastian Kurz's resignation? In 2017, Kurz took over the leadership of the right-wing ÖVP and subsequently became chancellor as the head of a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). He and nine other people, as well as three organizations, are under investigation over the alleged offenses, prosecutors said. Announcing his resignation on Saturday, Kurz insisted again that the accusations against him ""are false and I will be able to clear this up… I am deeply convinced of that."" Second stint as chancellor Kurz previously resigned as chancellor in May 2019, pulling the plug on the coalition with the FPÖ over the so-called Ibiza-gate corruption scandal. A video showed then FPÖ chief Heinz-Christian Strache — who was also the vice-chancellor at the time — appearing to offer public contracts in exchange for campaign help. Since the scandal, investigators have launched several investigations into alleged corruption, some of them targeting top ÖVP politicians such as Finance Minister Blümel. Kurz started his second term as the head of government in January 2020, leading a coalition with the Green party as the junior partner."

To that end, he’s heading for Beverly Hills — records reveal the semi-mysterious businessman, who is a son of former Afghan Minister of Defense Abdul Rahim Wardak, has bought a $20.9 million mansion on a prime Trousdale Estates street. Built all-new this year and designed by local architecture firm Woods + Dangaran, the nearly 9,000-square-foot house was described in an off-market listing as a fusion of “modern meets midcentury.” The 0.58-acre property last sold in 2016 for $9.5 million to the Woodbridge Group, a now-defunct Ponzi scheme; Woodbridge demolished the original house on the lot, and the new structure was sold to Wardak on behalf of Woodbridge’s bankruptcy proceedings by Viewpoint Collection, a premier developer of high-end Los Angeles homes. The new house replaced a smaller but seductively curvaceous 1960s midcentury modern long owned by Sally Hershberger, a Kansas oil heiress-turned-L.A.’s infamous “hairstylist to the stars.” During her ownership tenure, Hershberger leased the property to Candace Nelson, founder of the Sprinkles Cupcakes and Pizzana food chains, before selling it in 2013 for $6.9 million to a Florida-based businessman. As for the current house, the strikingly angular structure packs five bedrooms and seven bathrooms into its glassy walls, which offer views of the Downtown L.A. skyline. Unvarnished woods and other natural materials define the interiors, which offer a muted palette of gray and cream tones. Contemporary minimalism appears to be a theme — there’s a central courtyard with a solitary olive tree, plus flat ceilings punctured only by recessed LED lights. Even the plantings in the drought-resistant yard are semi-wild and mildly overgrown in their own trendy manner. Out back, a rectangular pool sits just a few feet from the house. Story continues Not much is publicly known about the various business interests or wealth origins of Wardak, an ethnic Pashtun refugee who was born in Afghanistan in 1977. But public corporation records show he’s the president of a Miami-based firm called AD Capital Group. Various reports have also noted that his older brother Hamed Wardak, a Georgetown University grad and onetime valedictorian, is a successful businessman who runs military transportation company NCL Holdings. Based in Virginia but operating primarily in Afghanistan, NCL has secured lucrative U.S. government contracts in exchange for protecting American supply routes in Afghanistan; those contracts were reportedly worth north of a whopping $360 million.

Starving microorganisms capable of surviving in extreme conditions have already managed to ""eat"" a nail in just three days. In Chile, a scientist is testing ""metal-eating"" bacteria she hopes could help clean up the country's highly-polluting mining industry. In her laboratory in Antofagasta, an industrial town 1,100-kilometers north of Santiago, 33-year-old biotechnologist Nadac Reales has been carrying out tests with extremophiles—organisms that live in extreme environments. Reales came up with her idea while still at university as she was conducting tests at a mining plant using microorganisms to improve the extraction of copper. ""I realized there were various needs in the mining industry, for example what happened with the metallic waste,"" she told AFP. Some metals can be recycled in smelting plants but others, such as HGV truck hoppers that can hold 50 tons of rock, cannot and are often discarded in Chile's Atacama desert, home to the majority of the country's mining industry. Chile is the world's largest producer of copper, which accounts for up to 15 percent of the country's GDP, resulting in a lot of mining waste that pollutes the environment. In her research, Reales, who now runs her own company Rudanac Biotec, concentrated on iron-oxidizing bacteria called Leptospirillum. She extracted the bacteria from the Tatio geysers located 4,200 meters above sea level, some 350 kilometers from Antofagasta. The bacteria ""live in an acidic environment that is practically unaffected by relatively high concentrations of most metals,"" she said. ""At first the bacteria took two months to disintegrate a nail."" But when starved, they had to adapt and find a way of feeding themselves. After two years of trials, the result was a marked increase in the speed at which the bacteria ""ate,"" devouring a nail in just three days. Chilean scientist Nadac Robles hopes her 'metal eating' bacteria will make green mining ""totally feasible"" Surprising benefit Reales says ""chemical and microbiological tests"" have proved the bacteria are not harmful to humans or the environment. ""We've always seen a lot of potential in this project that has already passed an important test in the laboratory,"" said Drina Vejar, a microbiologist who is part of a four-person team working with Reales. ""It's really necessary at this time when we have to plan for a more sustainable development, especially in all these cities with so many polluting industries."" Mining companies have shown interest in the research but while Rudanac Biotec previously benefitted from a state fund for start-ups, the company needs investment to move on to its next stage of trials. Reales says she needs money to see if her method will ""eat a medium sized beam or a hopper."" When the disintegration process is complete, what remains is a reddish liquid residue, a solution known as a lixiviant that itself possesses a surprising quality. ""After biodisintegration the product generated (the liquid) can improve the recovery of copper in a process called hydrometallurgy,"" said Reales. Essentially, the liquid residue can be used to extract copper from rock in a more sustainable manner than the current use of chemicals in leaching. Reales says it means green mining is ""totally feasible."" That is of great interest to mining companies that could use it to improve their large scale extraction of copper or other minerals, while also reducing their pollution, something they are required to do by law. Reales recently submitted a request for an international patent for her technology, but more importantly she hopes it will help reduce metal waste blotting the landscape in the mining regions of her country.

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here. New Canadian data suggests the bold strategy to delay and mix second doses of COVID-19 vaccines led to strong protection from infection, hospitalization and death — even against the highly contagious delta variant — that could provide lessons for the world. Preliminary data from researchers at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and the Quebec National Institute of Public Health (INSPQ) shows the decision to vaccinate more Canadians sooner by delaying second shots by up to four months saved lives. The researchers excluded long-term care residents from the data, who are generally at increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, in order to get a better sense of vaccine effectiveness in the general population — and the results were exceptional. The analysis of close to 250,000 people in B.C. from May 30 to Sept. 11 found two doses of any of the three available COVID-19 vaccines in Canada were close to 95 per cent effective against hospitalization — regardless of the approved vaccination combination . That means for every 100 unvaccinated people severely ill in Canadian hospitals, 95 of them could have been prevented by receiving two doses of either the AstraZeneca-Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, or some combination of the three. Dr. Danuta Skowronski with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control laid the groundwork for the decision to hold back second doses and says the early vaccine effectiveness data is extremely encouraging. (Harman/CBC) Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a vaccine effectiveness expert and epidemiology lead at the BCCDC whose research laid the groundwork for the decision to hold back second doses based on the ""fundamental principles of vaccinology,"" says the early data is extremely encouraging. ""We were very pleased to see during the period when the delta variant was not just circulating, but predominating, that we had such high protection nonetheless against both infection and hospitalization,"" the lead researcher on the analysis told CBC News. ""Protection was even stronger when the interval between the first and the second doses was more than six weeks apart."" In fact, the research showed that protection against COVID-19 infection from two doses of the Pfizer vaccine rose dramatically when the first and second shots were spread out — from 82 per cent after three or four weeks, to 93 per cent after four months. ""For those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine as their first dose, their protection against any infection was lower than for mRNA vaccine recipients, but they had comparable protection against hospitalization and that's the main goal,"" she said. ""But for those who received a first dose of AstraZeneca and a second dose as an mRNA vaccine, their protection was as good as those who had received two mRNA vaccines. So that's also a really important finding from this analysis."" While the work is still being finalized and has not yet been submitted as a pre-print or undergone peer review, the researchers felt it's important to get their early data out now to inform the public and policymakers here and abroad about the positive results. ""The mix-and-match schedules are protecting well, and my preference would be that those countries who don't recognize that get to see our data as soon as possible,"" she said, adding that the findings were sent to U.S. officials for review of international travel policies . ""My hope is that when they see the evidence that they will change those policies, which are frankly inconsistent with the science."" Quebec data backs up findings from B.C. In Quebec, thousands of kilometres away and with a different population, demographic makeup and early vaccine rollout approach — the results of a twin study that will be published alongside the B.C. data were astonishingly similar. Of the 181 people who died from COVID-19 from May 30 to Sept. 11 in Quebec, just three were fully vaccinated. Researchers say that corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness against death upwards of 97 per cent based on a population analysis of nearly 1.3 million people. Similar to the B.C. data, the Quebec research also showed more than 92 per cent protection from hospitalizations — with Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines — against all circulating coronavirus variants of concern in Canada at that time, including delta. ""The takeaway is whatever vaccine people had, if they got two doses they should consider that they are very well protected against severe COVID-19,"" said Dr. Gaston De Serres, an epidemiologist at the INSPQ. ""That's the main message."" The analysis found Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 90 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 infections — either asymptomatic, symptomatic, or those needing hospital care — a protection rate equal to those with an AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccine combination. For people who received two doses of AstraZeneca, the research suggests a slightly lower level of protection from infection — but one that is still remarkably high at 82 per cent. The research showed that protection against COVID-19 infection from two doses of the Pfizer vaccine rose dramatically when the first and second shots were spread out. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) De Serres says the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and the Quebec Immunization Committee (CIQ) are looking at whether additional doses may be needed for that group, but says it's ""not as pressing"" given the strong protection from hospitalization. ""For the time being, just stay put. If there is a recommendation for you to get an additional RNA dose you'll know in time,"" De Serres said. ""But feel that what you've got is still a very good regimen to protect you against what we fear most — which is severe COVID-19."" The NACI recommendation in March to delay second doses of all three COVID-19 vaccines by up to four months was not without controversy at the time, and no doubt led to confusion among many Canadians about whether they were adequately protected. Canada's Chief Science Adviser Mona Nemer said in early March that the strategy amounted to a "" population level experiment ,"" while at the same time health officials tried to reassure the public that the approach was safe and effective. Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, says the results are ""very encouraging"" and provide evidence of ""improved real world protection"" from delaying second doses. But he admits even he was initially skeptical. ""I was uneasy about it in large part because I just wasn't sure how well the protection would hold up in the interim,"" he said. ""Obviously it turned out well … but it was risky, and that gamble paid off."" Bhattacharya says the Canadian data now provides real world evidence that vaccinated people produce more antibodies if their second shot is delayed, and the quality of those antibodies may actually improve — which could explain the better protection against delta. ""What I'm really wondering now going forward is whether the recommendations are going to fundamentally change as to when we should get that second shot,"" he said, referring to other countries around the world. ""I wish I'd gotten mine later now in retrospect."" Keeping 'eye on the prize' means avoiding hospitalization The data also has implications on whether average Canadians need booster shots, particularly given that emerging real world data in other countries like the U.S. , Israel and Qatar show evidence of waning immunity that has prompted the rollout of third doses. But experts caution that while countries reporting diminished vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection may be making headlines, the more important factor is that the studies largely show the vaccines have prolonged protection against severe COVID-19 — meaning hospitalization and death. ""We really should keep our eyes on the prize, which is preserving healthcare system capacity and preventing unnecessary suffering,"" said Skowronski. ""We're not going to prevent every case of COVID-19. Our goal was never to prevent the sniffles. Our goal was to prevent serious outcomes."" Still, the B.C. and Quebec data showed ""no signs"" of waning immunity in the general population four months after the second mRNA dose and strong protection against infection of more than 80 to 90 per cent maintained. The analysis doesn't go beyond five months, but the researchers will continue monitoring vaccine effectiveness. ""We should be reassured that our vaccine effectiveness from this calculation, from what I've seen, will be robust with its protection,"" said Alyson Kelvin, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University and virologist at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology and the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon who was not involved in the research.

Private capital would be barred from news gathering and distribution operations, according to a public consultation paper posted on the website of National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner. Also off-limits would be private investments in the establishment and operation of news outlets, including news agencies, newspaper publishers and broadcasters. They will also not be permitted to reproduce news content generated by foreign media. The move is the latest salvo in China's broad regulatory crackdown this year on companies in industries including ride-hailing, e-commerce and after-school tutoring. The MSCI China Index has sunk 16 per cent this year on concerns about global inflation and interest rates, geopolitical tensions, how the new regulations would reshape businesses and where Beijing might strike next. The proposed bans are part of a broader document that also touches on entry barriers for various other industries including finance, Internet and agriculture. The seven-day public consultation is scheduled to end on Oct 14. While it wasn't immediately clear whether the proposed restrictions unveiled on Friday are fresh curbs or incremental rules designed to close loopholes that private investors had exploited, they do signal regulators' intent to step up enforcement. Private capital would further be banned from live streaming events that may sway political and public opinion, according to the proposal. That includes those in the realms of politics, the economy, military and foreign policy, and important social, cultural, scientific and sports events. Other out-of-bounds activities for private capital include operating frequencies and social-media accounts of news organisations, according to the proposal. Alibaba Group, for one, has invested in newspapers, BuzzFeed-style online outlets, Twitter-like social media platforms and TV production companies. Among those are Hong Kong's English-language newspaper South China Morning Post and mainland Chinese news provider Yicai Media Group. Alibaba's financial technology arm, Ant Group, has a stake in Caixin Media. Under increasing regulatory scrutiny, the Chinese e-commerce giant recently sought to break a one-year equity lock-up agreement and offload its stakes in Mango Excellent Media, a TV shopping and entertainment network, Mango revealed in a filing last month. While the restrictions would apply to only domestic investments, Alibaba has been pressed to sell its media assets outside of mainland China, including the South China Morning Post, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in March."

(AP Photo/Daniel Roca) LOS LLANOS DE ARIDANE, Canary Islands (AP) — A new river of lava belched Saturday from the La Palma volcano, spreading more destruction on the Atlantic Ocean island where over 1,000 buildings have already been engulfed or badly damaged by streams of molten rock. The partial collapse of the volcanic cone overnight gave birth to a new lava stream that started to follow a similar path down the Cumbre Vieja ridge toward the western shore of the island to the ocean. Authorities said the new lava flow is within the area that was hastily evacuated following the Sept. 19 eruption, when 6,000 residents were forced to flee their homes and farms. Police let residents whose homes could now be in danger make trips to save what they could. Trucks entered the exclusion zone empty Saturday and left with mattresses, furniture and other belongings. Emergency official Miguel Ángel Morcuende said experts were closely watching the delta of new land being formed off the island’s coast since the main lava flow reached the sea last week. He said that parts of it could collapse, causing explosions and large waves, but that would not pose a danger since the immediate area is already evacuated.

The task force said more than 29,000 new infections also were confirmed in the past day. Authorities blame the steep rise on the country’s low vaccination rate. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said Friday that 47.8 million Russians, or almost 33% of Russia’s nearly 146 million people, had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 42.4 million, or about 29%, were fully vaccinated. The coronavirus task force reports has reported a total of about 7.8 million cases and 215,453 deaths in the pandemic. However, the task force records only deaths directly caused by the virus.

However, even though this pledge of financial support—to mobilise $100 billion annually in climate finance to support the needs of developing countries—was made in 2010, much of it has still not been met. In fact, the UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa also personally urged the developed countries earlier this year in June to make good on their promise, according to an official statement by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Recognising that there is a need to desist from “cherry-picking” of the UNFCCC's structure, India's permanent representative to the UN, Tirumurti, said that the negotiation should be done by all the member-states and not just a few nations who tend to decide for all. “There is a need to desist from ‘cherry-picking’ from the inclusive and comprehensive structure of the UNFCCC,” the ANI news agency quoted Tirumurti as saying. “It is negotiated by all the member-states.

The trillions of dollars being spent by developed nations for recovery from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) shows that $100 billion annually could be mobilised “relatively easily with the adequate political will”, according to the UN.

""For the polar darkness period, from April through September, the average temperature was -60.9 degrees Celsius (-77.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a record for those months,"" the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said. The last six months is also the darkest period at the South Pole, which is where the name polar darkness (also called polar night) comes from. Here, the sun sets for the last time around the spring equinox, and does not rise again until near the autumn equinox six months later. For the entire Antarctic continent, the winter of 2021 was the second-coldest on record, with the ""temperature for June, July, and August 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 degrees Fahrenheit) lower than the 1981 to 2010 average at -62.9 degrees Celsius (-81.2 degrees Fahrenheit),"" according to a new report from the NSIDC. ""This is the second-coldest winter (June-July-August months) on record, behind only 2004 in the 60-year weather record at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station,"" the NSIDC said. Even in a warming world (climate change), there are areas of below average temperatures and record cold.  However, record highs will increasingly outpace the cold.  Here is an example of the large day-to-day temperature changes (weather) around the world: https://t.co/6VXvqV9a5T — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) February 10, 2021 ""The unusual cold was attributed to two extended periods of stronger-than-average encircling winds around the continent, which tend to isolate the ice sheet from warmer conditions,"" the NSIDC explained. ""A strong upper-atmosphere polar vortex was observed as well, leading to a significant ozone hole. The ozone hole appears to have peaked as of this post, with initial measurements reporting that it is in the upper quartile (top 25 percent) of ozone reduction events since 1979."" Even in the austral summer months of November through February, it never really gets ""warm"" at the South Pole. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which sits at an elevation of 2,835 meters (9,300 feet), has an average monthly temperature in the austral summer of -28°C (-18°F). The National Science Foundation, which runs the US Antarctic program, points out the winter temperatures have had minimal impact in science support from the South Pole, since most of the deep fieldwork occurs in the austral summer. However, the polar environments are still challenging. ""Everyone adapts to the cold differently, and today's gear makes it much safer than in the days when Shackleton and the other explorers had little specialized gear; they had only wool socks and leather shoes to protect their feet!"" a NSF spokesperson said. ""All of NSF's US Antarctic Program (USAP) participants are given extreme cold weather gear and are trained in how to recognize the dangers of extreme cold."" One extremely cold winter is intriguing from a record keeping standpoint, but one season alone does not change the long-term progression, which is rapid warming. Weather versus climate It is important to understand weather is different from climate. Weather is what happens over shorter periods of time (days to months), such as the seven-day forecast. Climate is what happens over much longer periods of time, such as several years, or even entire generations. ""One such example is a cold snap, which can happen due to sudden changes in atmospheric circulation and may not be linked to climate change,"" says Tom Slater, Research Fellow at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds. ""Texas is a good example of this; even though parts of it experienced extreme cold weather earlier this year when air from the Arctic was pushed south, looking at the long-term change in temperature tells us that Texas is 1.5 degrees warmer on average now than it was 100 years ago. That's climate."" Scientists also agree that since the 1950s extreme cold snaps do occur, but climate change is bringing far more heat records than cold records. ""In other words, while the globe may be warmer than average as a whole, some areas will still observe colder temperatures and even severe cold outbreaks,"" says Zack Labe, Climate Scientist at Colorado State University. ""This regional variation is due to the influences of the oceans, mountains, deserts, ice sheets, and other geographic features that all affect our weather and climate. It's also from changes in weather patterns that are related to the position of the jet stream (storm track), which can vary from day-to-day or even month-to-month."" So, this recent winter stretch from June-August is definitely interesting from a research standpoint, but it doesn't necessarily reflect what Antarctica is doing in the long term. One great example of this is while June-August of this year may have been quite cold, February of the previous year recorded the new all-time record high for the Antarctic continent. On February 6, 2020, the Esperanza Research Station recorded a high temperature of 18.3°C degrees (64.9°F). This broke the previous record for the Antarctic region (continental, including mainland and surrounding islands) of 17.5°C (63.5°F) recorded in March 2015 at the same station. ""There were thousands upon thousands of these penguins just in distress because they were so overheated and there was no snow,"" Camille Seaman, a photographer who has traveled to Antarctica, told CNN in August ""They were looking for any little patch of snow or ice to lay on."" Polar opposites What is happening at one pole, does not mean it is happening at the other. Thanks to the extreme cold near the South Pole, Antarctic sea ice extent has been above average the last few months, peaking in late August when it reached the 5th highest in the satellite record. Antarctic sea ice extent has been above average for the past several months, culminating in late August when extent was the 5th highest in the satellite record. Since peaking on September 1, sea ice extent has declined steeply.

The summer of 2021 was relatively cool near the North Pole compared to many recent years, according to the NSIDC, which allowed September's ice extent to be the highest since 2014 However, while it may sound good, keep in mind the last 15 years (2007 to 2021) have had the 15 lowest September ice extents on record.

""Although global temperatures have risen by about 1.1 degrees in the past 150 years on average, different parts of the globe have warmed at different rates due to natural variations in the climate system such as cloud cover, land cover and atmospheric circulation patterns,"" Slater said. ""Earth's poles have warmed faster than anywhere else, primarily due to melting ice and snow. Although Antarctica has had a cold winter this year, over the past few decades the most northerly parts of Antarctica have warmed five times faster than the global average -- that's faster than anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere."" While scientists take note of the changes occurring at Earth's poles, the bigger danger lies in the more populated continents where people live and work. ""As a climate scientist, I am particularly alarmed at how extreme heatwaves, such as the one which impacted the Pacific Northwest this summer, are projected to become more common in the future,"" Labe said.

The results mean opposition coalitions could now join forces to grab power after a dramatic day at the ballot box. Andrej Babiš's ANO party was edged out by the narrowest of margins by the two opposition coalitions trying to unseat him, according to the Czech Statistical Office. With 100% of the votes counted, the center-right alliance Spolu (Together) won the most votes with 27.79% of the ballots, followed by Babiš's ANO party with 27.12%, and the centrist PirStan coalition on 15.62%, according to a tally of votes on the statistical office's website. While Babiš's party ANO won the most votes of any single party, it does not have any clear path to a majority after Saturday's vote. ""We are the change. You are the change,"" Spolu coalition leader Petr Fiala said Saturday, claiming victory before a cheering crowd. The leader of the PirStan coalition, Ivan Bartoš, said talks with Spolu ""on the possibilities of forming a new government"" would likely begin on Saturday. ""The dominance of Andrej Babiš is over, and the democratic parties have shown that the era of chaos will probably be behind us,"" Bartoš said. After winning a combined 108 seats in the 200-seat lower house on Saturday, talks between the two coalitions who campaigned against Babiš ended with the leaders of the five parties in the combined coalitions signing a memorandum to work together to form the next government. The memorandum was a challenge to President Miloš Zeman who has said prior to the election that he would choose the leader of the single party with the largest vote count, and not any coalition, to form the next government. Addressing a news conference in Prague, Fiala said ""what is fundamental is that according to the Constitution of the Czech Republic, the government must command a majority in the lower house."" ""Let's expect that everyone will respect the constitutional customs, the will of the voters, and soon come to the conclusion that those who have a majority of the votes and the will to form a government will have a chance to create it,"" Fiala added. A new government would distance the Czech Republic from populist parties in Hungary and Poland, which have increasingly come under fire for rolling back European Union democratic values. The only other party to win seats, the far-right, anti-immigration SPD, had 9.58% of votes toward the end of the vote count, while the Social Democrats -- part of the current governing coalition -- held on at 4.66% of votes in that same time period. If the results stand, they would mean that for the first time since the end of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution and the subsequent split with Slovakia in 1993, members of the successor to the Communist Party would not be represented in Czech parliament. During the election, Babiš, once dubbed the ""Czech Trump"" by some local media outlets because of his vast business empire and populist leanings, campaigned heavily on an anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic platform. The 67-year-old business tycoon also faced challenges from opposition parties over his financial dealings, which they claimed represented a conflict of interest. Pandora's box of scandals The tight election also comes just days after a Pandora Papers investigation into controversial financial dealings by Babiš and other world leaders. The report claimed the Czech prime minister secretly moved $22 million through offshore companies to purchase an estate on the French Riviera in 2009, before he entered politics. Responding on Twitter, Babiš wrote: ""There is no case that they can pull against me during the time I am in politics. ""I have never done anything unlawful or bad, but it does not stop them to try to slander me again and to try to influence Czech parliamentary elections,"" he added. A businessman who is worth about $3.4 billion, according to Bloomberg, Babiš has railed against the elite since he became prime minister in 2017, vowing to crack down on tax avoidance. But his premiership has been dogged by long-standing allegations of financial impropriety. In 2019, tens of thousands of Czechs took to the streets in some of the biggest protests since the 1989 revolution over Babiš's financial affairs and other issues. As the owner of the Agrofert conglomerate of food, chemicals and media companies, Babiš was one of the richest business tycoons in the Czech Republic. In 2017, he placed the business into a trust, as required by law in order to remain in his post as finance minister. He became prime minister later that year. But a European Commission audit later found Babiš breached conflict of interest rules over his control of trust funds linked to Agrofert. Babiš rejected the findings, saying the audit was ""manipulated and artificially induced by professional snitches"" from the ranks of opposition parties."

The South American nation, which holds half the continent's population, has now suffered 600,425 coronavirus deaths. It is only the second country to pass the 600,000 mark, after the US which has registered 712,695 deaths. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticized for his handling of the pandemic. The conservative populist leader has repeatedly downplayed the gravity of the outbreak, declared he would not get vaccinated because he had already had Covid-19, and championed the unproven malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. Over the past year, Bolsonaro has frequently raged against municipal and state-level lockdown orders in Brazil, even during the grimmest moments of the pandemic, when hospitals filled to capacity and whole cities ran out of oxygen. Earlier this month, thousands of protesters gathered in major cities across Brazil, calling for the President's impeachment amid worsening economic conditions, rising unemployment, and hunger in the Covid-wracked country. Bolsonaro, who is up for reelection next year, told world leaders at the United Nations' General Assembly last month that while he regrets ""all of the deaths that took place in Brazil and worldwide,"" the toll of unemployment must be balanced against that of the coronavirus. Deaths have risen sharply in Brazil, which in June passed the 500,000 mark. Vaccines offer hope But despite Friday's tragic milestone, there are now signs that infections in Brazil are finally ebbing, as the country ramps up vaccinations after a slow start, Reuters reports. More than 70% of Brazilians have received a first dose, compared to 65% in the United States. ""The rejection rate of vaccines is really low, it makes other countries jealous,"" said Alexandre Naime Barbosa , head of epidemiology at Sao Paulo State University. ""That's really important for Brazil to contain the pandemic."" Brazil also appears to have been spared the worst of the Delta variant so far, with registered deaths and cases falling despite the arrival of the more contagious strain."

It was launched by Boris Johnson on 29 August to help Afghan refugees arriving in the UK by providing support so they could “rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education and integrate into their local communities”. However, a widespread lack of housing means hotels have been commandeered as emergency temporary accommodation for 7,000 Afghan refugees, with Home Office officials admitting that some will be held in them for months. Already some refugees have had enough. One doctor, who has been working with the newly arrived Afghans for weeks but who requested anonymity, said: “I’ve had a few patients telling me they want to go home. One guy, who was 67, kept saying: ‘I can’t take this any more. I have to get out of this [hotel] room.’ ” The GP, an Afghan who fled the country in 2000 when the Taliban were previously in power, added: “Another said: ‘I just want my freedom from the hotel.’ I had to put him on medication, and his wife, because they were so upset.” There are also concerns over healthcare for those held in hotels following the evacuation from Kabul airport, with one charity describing confusion over access to local GPs. One council leader described the government’s programme as a “shocking failure”. Councillor Danny Thorpe of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, south-east London, said the lack of organised government support when 700 Afghans arrived in the borough in August was “unforgivable”. “This was one of the most shocking failures of government that I ever encountered,” he said. Thorpe accused government officials of not providing enough support or sending enough officials when hundreds of Afghans were initially put up in hotels in his borough during their 10-day Covid quarantine. He said: “There was a huge mismatch between the rhetoric of senior government politicians and their actions to support those people.” When Greenwich council told the government they were about to run out of baby milk, Thorpe claims they were told that some would be delivered “in a few days”. In Sheffield, where a five-year-old Afghan refugee fell to his death from a hotel window in August soon after arriving in the UK, the local council has concerns over the suitability of hotels for holding Afghan refugees. A spokesperson said it had shared its misgivings with the Home Office, but would not elaborate on what response it received. Meanwhile, the Local Government Association, which represents 328 of the 333 councils in England, called on the Home Office to reduce confusion in data that it is sending to different locations over the actual numbers of Afghans and their needs. “The government needs to engage more fully with local authorities and share regular data about numbers, needs and strengths of Afghan refugees and others recently resettled,” said an LGA spokesperson. Jill O’Leary, lead doctor at the Helen Bamber Foundation, which is working with 650 clients, said the situation was “muddled and confused”, with certain contractors at hotels unaware they were obligated to help Afghans register with a GP and explain their entitlements. “When we consider the needs of people, there seems to be a blind spot with the Home Office when it comes to vulnerability,” she said. A spokesperson for Medact, a health charity that campaigns to protect human rights to healthcare, said they were concerned with the provisions for asylum seekers, including those under Operation Warm Welcome. They said: “The Home Office has a legal duty to provide at least minimal support to otherwise destitute asylum seekers, but arrangements by the Home Office and its contractors to house those waiting in interim publicly funded accommodation are medically dangerous.” The Afghan GP added that initially when Afghan arrivals were placed in hotels there was “inadequate” medical provision. She described one incident at a hotel where she found a malnourished disabled child who had not been registered with the medical authorities. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK’s biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history helped over 15,000 people to safety, and hotels remain a temporary measure to help accommodate those we brought here. It is going to take time to find permanent homes for everyone but we are working urgently with our partners to do so. “Our aim is to support everyone who is resettled here to build a successful life in the UK, and that is why we work around the clock to provide wrap-around support to families. This includes working closely with local authorities across the UK to ensure everyone temporarily accommodated in hotels has access to essential provisions, healthcare, education and universal credit.”"

WADA said the committee voted Friday to endorse a disciplinary committee recommendation to strip the Moscow lab of handling blood samples for failing to comply with International Standard for Laboratories (ISL) regulations and its Code of Ethics. The Moscow lab, which was already provisionally suspended since January 2020, was notified of the decision, which keeps it ineligible to carry out any work related to the analysis of blood samples in connection with athlete biological passports or any anti-doping analysis for organizations compliant with WADA's code. The lab can appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) within 21 days of its receipt of the decision. Following last year's provisional suspension, the disciplinary committee was required to make a recommendation to the WADA executive committee regarding the lab's status for blood work in athlete biological passports. The committee study was delayed until CAS rendered a decision last December in a lab appeal. WADA requested to reopen the revocation disciplinary proceedings in January. WADA said that based on documents provided by the parties, the committee found lab personnel manipulation of data was ""detrimental to the anti-doping program"" and a serious violation that justified the revocation of accreditation. © 2021 AFP"

Over the last five years, the 100 top ranked law firms in the US facilitated $1.36tn of fossil fuel transactions, represented fossil fuel clients in 358 legal cases and received $35m in compensation for their work to assist fossil fuel industry lobbying, according to a “climate scorecard” published in August. The scale of law firms’ work for the fossil fuel industry is huge, said Tim Herschel-Burns, a third year student at Yale Law School and co-founder of Law Students for Climate Accountability, which developed the scorecard. “As we started digging we realised how holistic this is. Everything fossil fuel companies want to do, they need lawyers to accomplish.” Fossil fuel companies rely heavily on armies of lawyers to advise on projects, lobby, negotiate contracts, secure permits and navigate an increasing number of climate lawsuits. Law firms’ fossil fuel industry work has increased compared with the previous year’s scorecard, even as climate warnings become more dire and the International Energy Agency has warned new fossil fuel development is incompatible with the target of net zero emissions by 2050. The climate scorecard awarded firms grades based on their involvement in lawsuits “exacerbating climate change”, their support for fossil fuel transactions and fees received for lobbying on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. Paul Weiss, a top 10 US firm according to Vault Law’s rankings, was one of 37 to receive the lowest F grade. The firm, which has its own sustainability practice, has acted for fossil fuel companies in 30 cases over the last five years, according to the scorecard. Among the most high-profile was the firm’s work representing ExxonMobil in a landmark trial where the company was accused of having misled investors about the risks of climate change to its business. The court ruled in favour of Exxon in 2019. Paul Weiss did not respond to a request for comment. Climate protesters in October 2019 outside the New York county courthouse, where the trial against Exxon took place. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA Only 12 law firms were rated an A or B in the scorecard, which meant they did not conduct work for fossil fuel clients. Three firms – Cooley; Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati; and Schulte Roth & Zabel – have actively addressed the climate crisis through renewable energy transactions, lobbying or pro-climate litigation, according to the scorecard report. “We definitely agree that the law can be this force for good,” said Herschel-Burns. “But one thing that we found really striking is that overwhelmingly the top law firms are [representing] the wrong side of it.” There’s a tangible human cost, said Alyssa Johl, legal director for the Center for Climate Integrity. “Elite law firms are representing the oil and gas companies and providing them with a deep bench of high-priced lawyers,” she said. “For the communities across the country that are seeking justice, the end result is that their cases have been delayed and bogged down by procedural hurdles put forward by some of the biggest law firms in the country.” Law Students for Climate Accountability is calling on law firms to pledge to stop taking on new fossil fuel industry work, phase out their current work by 2025 and ramp up their work for the renewable energy industry and in support of litigation to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a potentially controversial stance given the principle that everyone should have access to legal representation. But Herschel-Burns said this principle is often used in “really sloppy ways which end up justifying law firms being able to represent whoever pays the most”. Some firms have acknowledged a choice. Speaking at a conference last year about the link between law and climate change, the global senior partner at Clifford Chance Jeroen Ouwehand said firms “can choose what we support, and what we don’t support. We do not have to be neutral professional service providers”. Law firms are starting to ramp up their own climate action, even as they continue their fossil fuel work. A number of firms that scored F grades on the climate scorecard, including Shearman & Sterling and Hogan Lovells, have signed up to the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance, which launched in July. Members pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and to work with clients to embed climate goals and to help drive “systemic change”. Neither firm responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. Another alliance member, DLA Piper, has set its own science-based target to halve all emissions by 2030, including indirect emissions from the firm’s supply chain. The firm was recently appointed official legal services provider for the forthcoming Cop26 climate talks. But it scored only a D on the climate scorecard and has represented clients including Shell, ExxonMobil and BP. The firm declined to comment. Thom Wetzer, law professor and director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme, one of the organisations supporting the alliance, said the firms may be serious about taking steps in the right direction but they do not necessarily have the best practices yet. “We need to move the whole sector, and for many firms involved this is the start of a journey.” Some law firms that ranked low on the climate scorecard were keen to promote their green energy work. Allen & Overy, which according to the scorecard worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $125bn over the last five years, said in a statement that it does “more renewables work than any other law firm in the world by most key measures”. Clifford Chance, which the scorecard calculated worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $123bn, said it is “perennially at or near the top” for advising on renewables financing. But neither firm, both of which scored an F, responded to questions about how they reconcile this work with their representation of fossil fuel firms. Lawyers have a responsibility to reflect on their own role and to ask whether their clients’ values align with their own, Wetzer said. “Firms that engage constructively with the net zero transition will be rewarded; clients will value their judgment and expertise, top talent will be more easily attracted and retained, and these firms will strengthen their social license to operate.” Law firms’ best resource is their employees, said Sam Sankar, of the nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice, which makes the climate scorecard a powerful tool. “In the future nobody is going to think twice about making career decisions with an eye to whether it aligns with their climate ethics.” There’s now a conversation about legal ethics and climate which is well overdue, Sankar said. “The [fossil fuel] industry is paying law firms tons of money in an effort to dodge responsibility and block regulatory reforms that could help avert this crisis.”"

Four farmers died Sunday when a car owned by Junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra ran over a group of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, a town in Uttar Pradesh state, officials and farm leaders said. Farm leaders alleged that Mishra’s son was in the car when it ran over the protesters, but Mishra denied it. His driver and three members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, who were in a car, were all killed by the protesters by beating them with sticks in the violence that broke out after the incident. Police officer Upendra Agarwal said on Saturday that Ashish Misra was arrested following day-long questioning in the town after ""he failed to furnish any supportive evidence to prove that he was not present in any of the three vehicles that plowed through a crowd of farmers killing four of them."" His father Ajay Mishra said that his son was innocent and that he was not present. The arrest came a day after India’s top court criticized the state government for not arresting Ashish Mishra against whom a criminal case of murder is being investigated by the police. On Friday, Mishra made the police wait for hours for questioning before sending a message that he was unwell and couldn’t make it. Darshan Pal, a farmers’ leader, and Akhilesh Singh, an opposition Congress party leader, demanded the removal of his father from Modi’s government. Police earlier this week said they had so far arrested six people and filed a criminal complaint against 14 more, including the minister’s son, in connection with the deaths of the four farmers. The BJP also lodged a criminal complaint against the farmers over the deaths of its members and the car driver, said Arvind Chaurasia, a senior official in charge of the district. Police also said they recovered the body of a local journalist where violence ensued Sunday but did not provide further details on how he was killed. The violence marked an escalation in ongoing protests against agriculture laws that farmers say will shatter their livelihoods. The protests have lasted since the government passed the laws last September and have been one of the biggest challenges to Modi. Last week, thousands of farmers gathered at the edges of the capital New Delhi to mark one year of demonstrations. The government says the changes in the laws were needed to modernize agriculture and boost production through private investment. But the farmers say the laws will devastate their earnings by ending guaranteed pricing and will force them to sell their crops to corporations at cheaper prices.

Senior Taliban officials and US representatives are to meet on Saturday and Sunday in Doha, the capital of Qatar. Officials from both sides have said issues include reining in extremist groups and the evacuation of foreign citizens and Afghans from the country. The Taliban have signalled flexibility on evacuations. However, Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the Associated Press there would be no cooperation with Washington on containing the increasingly active Islamic State group in Afghanistan. IS has taken responsibility for a number of recent attacks, including a suicide bombing on Friday that killed 46 Shia Muslims and wounded dozens as they prayed in a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz. “We are able to tackle Daesh independently,” Shaheen said, when asked whether the Taliban would work with the US to contain the IS affiliate. He used an Arabic acronym for IS. IS has carried out relentless assaults on the country’s minority Shia population since emerging in eastern Afghanistan in 2014. It is also seen as the terror group that poses the greatest threat to the US for its potential to stage attacks on American targets. The weekend meetings in Doha are the first since US forces withdrew from Afghanistan in late August, ending a 20-year military presence as the Taliban overran the country. The US has made it clear the talks are not a preamble to recognition. The Biden administration has fielded questions and complaints about the slow pace of US-facilitated evacuations from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan since the last US forces and diplomats left there at the end of August. The state department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday that 105 US citizens and 95 green card holders had left since then on flights facilitated by the US. That number had not changed for more than a week. US veterans and other individuals have helped people leave the country on charter flights, and some Americans and others have got out across land borders. That leaves dozens of American citizens still seeking to leave, according to the state department, along with thousands of green card holders and Afghans and family members believed eligible for US visas. US officials have cited the difficulty of verifying flight manifests without any American officials on the ground in Afghanistan to help, along with other hold-ups. The US also intends to press the Taliban to observe the rights of women and girls, many of whom the Taliban are reportedly blocking from returning to jobs and classrooms, and of Afghans at large, and to form an inclusive government, the official said. US officials will also encourage Taliban officials to give humanitarian agencies free access to areas in need amid the economic upheaval after the US departure and Taliban takeover.  "

Taiwan responded to Xi by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan's people could decide their future. Democratically ruled Taiwan has come under increased military and political pressure from Beijing to accept its sovereignty, but Taipei has pledged to defend its freedom. Speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi said the Chinese people have a ""glorious tradition"" of opposing separatism. ""Taiwan independence separatism is the biggest obstacle to achieving the reunification of the motherland, and the most serious hidden danger to national rejuvenation,"" he said on the anniversary of the revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911. Peaceful ""reunification"" best meets the overall interests of the Taiwanese people, but China will protect its sovereignty and unity, he added. ""No one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Xi said. ""The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled."" He struck a slightly softer tone than in July, his last major speech mentioning Taiwan, in which he vowed to ""smash"" any attempts at formal independence. In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing's control. 'PROVOCATIVE STEPS' Still, the speech was poorly received in Taiwan. The presidential office said they were a sovereign independent country, not part of the People's Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China's offer of ""one country, two systems"" to rule the island. ""The nation's future rests in the hands of Taiwan's people,"" the office said.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson reiterated Washington's ""rock-solid"" commitment to Taiwan and said the United States will ""continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan."" ""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan,"" the spokesperson said. China's air force mounted four straight days of incursions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone from Oct. 1, involving close to 150 aircraft, though those missions have since ended. Xi made no mention of those flights. Taiwan officially calls itself the Republic of China, the name of the country established in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. That government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who set up today's People's Republic. Taiwan marks Oct. 10, the date when the anti-imperial revolution began in China, as its national day, and President Tsai Ing-wen will give a keynote address in Taipei on Sunday. Tsai, speaking at a pre-national day reception at an air base in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu on Saturday night, thanked the armed forces for protecting Taiwan, though did not mention the tensions with China. ""We will continue to work hard to hold fast the front lines of democracy and freedom,"" she said. China commemorates the revolution by harking back to republican leader Sun Yat-sen's calls for patriotism, national rejuvenation and good governance. Xi used the speech to underscore the need for ""a strong force to lead the country, and this strong force is the Chinese Communist Party"". ""Without the Chinese Communist Party, there would not be a New China, and therefore no rejuvenation of the Chinese people,"" he said. Xi has tightened party control in all aspects of life and is almost certain to break protocol and stay on as Communist Party boss for a third term late next year, when a congress will elect a new leadership for the following five years.

One Ebola case has been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) just five months after the latest epidemic of the disease in the country was declared over. A three-year-old boy tested positive near the eastern city of Beni, one of the epicentres of the 2018-2020 outbreak, and died from the disease on Wednesday, Health Minister Jean Jacques Mbungani said in a statement on Friday. It was not immediately known if the case was related to the 2018-2020 outbreak that killed more than 2,200 people in eastern DRC, the second deadliest on record, or the flare-up that killed six this year. About 100 people, who may have been exposed to the virus, have been identified and will be monitored to see if they develop any symptoms, the statement added. An internal report from DRC’s biomedical laboratory said that three of the toddler’s neighbours in Beni’s densely populated Butsili neighbourhood also presented symptoms consistent with Ebola last month and died, but none were tested. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement saying that it was working with “health authorities to investigate the case”. The #DRC Ministry of Health just announced that a new case of Ebola has been detected in North Kivu Province, where a previous outbreak was declared over 3 May 2021. @WHO is working with health authorities to investigate the case. — WHO African Region (@WHOAFRO) October 8, 2021 The DRC has recorded 12 previous outbreaks since the disease was discovered in the equatorial forest near the Ebola River in 1976. It causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and is spread through contact with body fluids. The disease reappeared in February in an area of North Kivu that, between August 2018 and June 2020, experienced the largest outbreak of Ebola in the history of the DRC – 3,470 infections and 2,287 deaths. Health experts say it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak. Particles of the virus can remain present in semen for months after recovery from an infection. The disease typically kills about half of those it infects although treatments developed in West Africa have significantly reduced death rates when cases are detected early. Two highly effective vaccines have also been used to contain outbreaks since then."

Gangs of the outlaws on motorcycles attack rural villages where they murder, rape, steal and take hostages. The large bands often outnumber police and security in the settlements they attack. There are thousands of such bandits, according to security experts. The bandits are often better equipped than the Nigerian military, according to Abdulaziz Yari, a former governor of Zamfara state, the center of the crisis.

A two-year investigation by international NGO Global Witness has revealed the shocking extent of human rights abuses and rampant deforestation in Papua New Guinea. The South Pacific nation is home to the world’s third-largest remaining rainforest: a critical carbon sink helping to mitigate the climate crisis. But under firms supplying household names like Nestlé, Kellogg’s and Colgate, tens of thousands of hectares of tropical forest are being destroyed. “Papua New Guinean communities have managed and protected their forests sustainably for countless generations,” Lela Stanley, senior investigator at Global Witness said. Land has been cleared for Oil Palm plantations in the Bainings region of East New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Global Witness “This investigation shows they are being sold out by their own government and global financial institutions in favour of a small number of highly destructive companies, with devastating human rights and environmental consequences.” As this tainted palm oil continues to circulate in European supply chains, the NGO is calling for strong EU action to end complicity and demand change in the industry. What did Global Witness uncover? Global Witness’s investigation exposed the exploitative actions of the country’s three newest palm oil plantations, including the East New Britain Resources Group (ENB). On tape, top ENB executives were recorded bragging to undercover investigators that they had bribed a Papua New Guinean minister; paid police to brutalise villagers; used child labour; and participated in an apparent tax evasion scheme. In the village of Watwat, men and boys as young as 16 were dragged from their beds one night in July 2019. “When the boys woke up, they were at gunpoint. They tied their hands at the back and blindfolded their faces so they could not see,” a resident said. “When the boys woke up, they were at gunpoint. They tied their hands at the back and blindfolded their faces so they could not see” Resident of Watwat village Five youths were beaten and held for weeks, part of a sustained pattern of abuse directed at communities suspected of opposing the companies’ ravaging activities. Asked by Global Witness whether anything good had come from palm oil development, another villager said “only destruction.” A second palm oil firm, Rimbunan Hijau, ignored repeated and avoidable worker deaths and injuries on its plantations, with at least 11 workers and the child of a worker losing their lives over an eight-year period. The NGO’s investigation also raises serious concerns that plantations such as these were operating on grabbed land - in violation of land laws in Papua New Guinea. Filmed covertly, ENB boss Eng Kwee Tan described the firm's international tax evasion scheme. Global Witness Why is the Papua New Guinean rainforest so important? Covering half of the massive island of New Guinea, Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the most biodiverse places in the world. It sustains at least five per cent of all species on Earth, many found nowhere else: forest dragons, tree kangaroos, resplendent birds of paradise, and the only known night-blooming orchid. Billions of metric tonnes of carbon are stored in its towering trees, making them a vital carbon sink and a key resource in the fight against climate change. All of this is imperilled by the palm oil industry, Global Witness has discovered, through using satellite imagery, analysing company records and interviewing local people. The threat is growing: by 2030, the PNG government is aiming for a tenfold expansion in oil palm cultivation to 1.5m hectares (ha), compared to about 150,000 ha in 2016. A landowner walks across forest land destroyed in East New Britain, PNG. Global Witness Who is handling the tainted palm oil? For the first time, the extensive investigation has revealed that dirty palm oil and its byproducts are being sold to household brands including Kellogg’s, Nestlé, Colgate, Danone, Hershey, and the parent companies of Imperial Leather and Strepsils. It’s not just the names on our supermarket shelves that are complicit. Two of the palm oil suppliers received direct and indirect backing from global financiers such as Robeco and BlackRock. ""This investigation is yet further confirmation that the global financial system is broken – the business-as-usual, voluntary approach of past years has led us into climate crisis,” says senior investigator Ms Stanley. ""Firms like BlackRock talk a big game on their commitment tackling climate change and protecting human rights, yet our revelations show its money is ultimately financing the destruction of climate-critical forests, the use of child labour, and other human rights abuses. ""It is increasingly urgent that governments legislate to prevent supply chains and global financiers bankrolling deforestation and human rights abuses."" What can European companies and citizens do? The presence of the liquid gold foodstuff in so many of our products puts pressure on us all to push for change. Global Witness points to the upcoming EU legislative proposal on tackling deforestation - set to be published on November 17th - as an opportune moment to do so. The European Commission’s current approach reportedly has several loopholes which could limit its aim of addressing tainted products in EU supply chains. To stop enabling human rights abuses and environmental degradation in PNG, the proposal must require compliance with international human rights instruments and principles, such as obtaining Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of indigenous peoples and local communities. Without this, EU-based businesses are relying on uneven national standards, and EU consumers cannot guarantee we are purchasing deforestation-free products."

Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son are listed in leaked documents on tax havens dubbed the ""Pandora Papers,"" at a time when managing wealth through offshore tax shelters has drawn criticism worldwide. The names found in materials obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists also include Takeo Hirata, a former head of the Cabinet Secretariat section that was in charge of promoting the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. The documents, dubbed the Pandora Papers by the Washington-based ICIJ, are leaked internal files from 14 entities, such as trust companies and law firms specializing in establishing and managing firms in tax havens. Kyodo News is a media partner of the ICIJ project, which came to prominence after similar leaked documents called the ""Panama Papers"" in 2016 brought public attention to the issue of tax avoidance by the world's wealthiest people and companies. According to the documents, Son purchased a business jet around 2014 through a company established in 2009 in the Cayman Islands, a British territory considered a corporate tax haven. The ownership of the aircraft was transferred to a U.S. trust company and Son pays fees when he uses the jet based on a lease contract. It is possible for someone in that situation to reduce their taxable income by paying usage fees of such an aircraft even if they effectively own it, as the fees can be considered a loss, according to legal and financial experts. A SoftBank spokesperson denied Son processed the fees in such a manner, saying that the Cayman Islands company is a subsidiary of a Japanese company headed by Son and that the lease contract does not constitute tax avoidance. The Pandora Papers meanwhile showed that Hirata established a company in the British Virgin Islands in 2004 during his tenure as general secretary of the Japan Football Association, and liquidated it in 2008. Hirata, a former bureaucrat of the then Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said he heard about tax havens from negotiating partners he encountered when working on soccer and oil-related matters. ""I wanted to learn what it was like. I did not move any money even once,"" said Hirata. Hirata resigned in August from the Cabinet Secretariat section promoting the Tokyo Games following a weekly magazine report that he had used a government vehicle to go to expensive golf lessons, and that he had been offered the lessons free of charge. Another person mentioned in the papers, George Hara, a technology venture capitalist who served as a special adviser to Japan's Cabinet Office, owns a company in the Virgin Islands. When approached about the matter, Hara said the company needed to be set up to meet requirements when launching new businesses in different countries. The documents show the company, created for investment activities in Japan, had assets valued at $31 million as of 2017, but Hara contests that information. A former executive of a now-collapsed Japanese chemical company owns a firm in the Virgin Islands with assets worth around $12.7 million. The company exists for the purpose of managing a foundation in Liechtenstein. ""I donated it before the bankruptcy. I don't know what happened to it afterward and the company is not mine,"" the former executive told Kyodo News. In 2013, the Don Quijote discount store chain said its founder Takao Yasuda would sell the shares he held in the retailer to a company in Singapore. But the leaked documents and other materials showed the firm in the Southeast Asian country is an asset management company owned by Yasuda. Corporate tax and levies on income from stock dividends are lower in Singapore, where Yasuda lives, than in Japan. A Don Quijote spokesperson said the discount retailer believes the tax treatment has been made within the rules."

See also: The Pillar of Shame: History of the harrowing tribute to the Tiananmen victims The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China and its liquidators Richard Tsoi and Elizabeth Tang said they received a letter from the university issued on Thursday, asking the defunct group to remove the statue by next Wednesday at 5:00 p.m. Photo: Kelly Ho/HKFP. According to the letter, if the Alliance fails to remove the sculpture before the deadline, “the Sculpture will be deemed abandoned and the University will not consider any future request from you in respect of the Sculpture, and the University will deal with the Sculpture at such time and in such manner as it thinks fit without further notice.” The eight-metre tall harrowing monument to those killed by the military during the crackdown has stood on the campus for 24 years. Photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP. The Tiananmen massacre occurred on June 4, 1989 ending months of student-led demonstrations in China. It is estimated that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died when the People’s Liberation Army was deployed to crack down on protesters in Beijing. ‘Unreasonable’ demand Tsoi, who resigned as a member of the Alliance’s executive committee earlier this year, said that the university’s request was “unreasonable.” The University of Hong Kong. Photo: Kelly Ho/HKFP. “Institutes of higher education not only answer to [their] students and other stakeholders in the institute, universities also have their social mission and historical responsibility,” Tsoi wrote in a letter to HKU in response to their request. “Continue letting the Pillar of Shame to stand in the HKU campus [demonstrates] exactly the University of Hong Kong’s persistence to values such as freedom and justice.” Tsoi also asked HKU to clarify whether the university was planning to remove the sculpture, and the reasoning behind such a decision. Photo: Kelly Ho/HKFP. The now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China received the artwork in 1997 as a gift. It voted last month to disband after a crackdown under the national security law saw its leadership arrested and charged, and its property frozen. Legal action The Danish artist who created the pillar, Jens Galschiøt, told HKFP that he was “shocked” by the news about the sculpture’s potential removal. Photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP. He remains the owner of the artwork despite lending it to the Alliance for a permanent exhibition and will assert his ownership, he said. “It is really difficult to remove it. It is really not fair to remove it in a week while it’s been there for 24 years,” he said, adding that it would normally take two to three months – with cranes and containers – to properly move a sculpture of such size. A hasty removal would destroy the sculpture, he said. “I can take them to court if they destroy it” He added that HKU never contacted him about the removal: “Nobody talked to me. I just hear about it from the press.” Amnesty International Demark decried HKU’s move in a statement: “The request to remove The Pillar of Shame from Hong Kong University shows how fear and self-censorship have spread in the wake of the crack down on civil rights in Hong Kong. China wants to erase the deaths of hundreds of peaceful students at Tiananmen Square in 1989 from the history books. But the world will not forget what happened when China crushed peaceful protest. Neither will the world forget how freedom of expression and other rights are being crushed in Hong Kong,” said Dan Hindsgaul, interim director at Amnesty. Photo: May James/HKFP. In a media statement, HKU said the statue belonged to an “external organisation” which publicly announced their disbandment: “Based on the latest risk assessment and legal advice, the University has written to the said organisation requesting it to remove the exhibit from the university campus. The University will continue to liaise with various stakeholders to handle the incident in a legal and reasonable manner.” Additional reporting: Selina Cheng and Tom Grundy."

The results are the first to emerge from a giant outdoor experiment, led by the University of Birmingham in which an old oak forest is bathed in elevated levels of CO2. This latest study adds to the field that looks at the use forests as effective carbon sinks, and potentially gives climate researchers a new tool in the fight against climate change. Increased carbon capture Over the first three years of a ten-year project, the 175-year-old oaks clearly responded to the CO2 by consistently increasing their rate of photosynthesis. Researchers are now measuring leaves, wood, roots, and soil to find out where the extra carbon captured ends up and for how long it stays locked up in the forest. The increase in photosynthesis was greatest in strong sunlight. The overall balance of key nutrient elements carbon and nitrogen did not change in the leaves. Keeping the carbon to nitrogen ratio constant suggests that the old trees have found ways of redirecting their elements, or found ways of bringing more nitrogen in from the soil to balance the carbon they are gaining from the air. The research was carried out at the Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility of the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR), in close collaboration with colleagues from Western Sydney University who run a very similar experiment in old eucalyptus forest (EucFACE). BIFoR FACE and EucFACE are the world’s two largest experiments investigating the effect of global change on nature. Birmingham researcher Anna Gardner, who carried out the measurements, said, “I’m really excited to contribute the first published science results to BIFoR FACE, an experiment of global importance. It was hard work conducting measurements at the top of a 25-meter oak day after day, but it was the only way to be sure how much extra the trees were photosynthesising.” MORE: Jane Goodall Enlists Fans to Help Plant a Trillion Trees Around the World by 2030 Professor David Ellsworth, EucFACE lead scientist, said “Previous work at EucFACE measured photosynthesis increased by up to a fifth in increased carbon dioxide. So, we now know how old forest responds in the warm-temperate climate that we have here in Sydney, and the mild temperate climate of the northern middle latitudes where Birmingham sits.” RELATED: Italy is Protecting its Giant Trees Forever – Monumental Trees that Can Live for Centuries Professor Rob MacKenzie, founding Director of BIFoR, said of the study, published in Tree Physiology, “It’s a delight to see the first piece of the carbon jigsaw for BIFoR FACE fall into place. We are sure now that the old trees are responding to future carbon dioxide levels. How the entire forest ecosystem responds is a much bigger question requiring many more detailed investigations. We are now pushing ahead with those investigations.” According to the Independent, he stated that this research could help with the forging of effective climate policy. “Of the [UK] prime minister’s top four climate targets—coal, cars, cash, and trees—trees are, perhaps surprisingly, the least well-understood as a climate control lever.” “Our work adds to the small body of results from laboratories-in-the-forest that are essential to guide climate policy.” Source: University of Birmingham BOOST This Ground-Breaking Research by Sharing to Social Media…"

That same month, the US froze most of the Afghan central bank's $9.5 billion in assets. Robert Hockett, a Cornell University professor of law and finance, previously told Insider's Natalie Musumeci that the Taliban is likely to never see those funds. Al Jazeera reported that Abdul Qahar Balkhi, the Taliban's foreign ministry spokesman, said after Tuesday's meeting that they wanted the UK to ""begin a new chapter of constructive relations"". In a statement, to the AP, the Taliban also said it was ""committed"" to maintaining good ties to other countries. ""In return, we want the international community to return the cash capital of the Afghan nation to our nation,"" the Taliban told the AP in reference to the $9.5 billion frozen assets. The AP also reported that aid to the country that accounted for 75% of its spending has been paused since the Taliban took over. In another move to increase the country's spending capacity, the Taliban also held meetings with neighboring Iran to discuss regulating trade, the AP reported."

Around 30,000 people are expected to visit the city in November for the international summit on climate change. Instead, delegates have been asked to take a daily lateral flow device test and will not need to show their vaccine status in order to access the main conference at the SEC or fringe events. The Scottish Government’s vaccine passport scheme began on Friday, but the mobile phone app accompanying it suffered from teething problems immediately after launch. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon said covid passport app was problem with NHS systems not the app Events with more than 10,000 people in attendance, as well as nightclubs and unseated indoor events with more than 500 people in the audience, all require visitors to show proof of vaccination. The Scotsman newspaper reported that the Scottish Hospitality Group was angered by the exemption for Cop26. Stephen Montgomery, a spokesman for the group, told the newspaper: “Hard-pressed hospitality businesses yet again have to suffer restrictions whilst understaffed and failing to recruit people to partake in implementing this policy even on October 18. “To have thousands of people descend on Glasgow from all around the world with no need for vaccine certification, it undermines the reason why we are doing this in the first place. “Are the Government in the same situation as we are in that they cannot find the staff to police it or are they finally realising there is no point? “Where is the bigger risk? 30,000 people from all over the world at the SEC or 400 people in a nightclub?” READ MORE: ScotRail workers WILL strike during climate conference, union announces Scottish Labour’s health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: “This is an admission from the SNP that their vaccine passport scheme isn’t fit for purpose. “The unworkable scheme would have caused chaos at Cop26 – but we should be scrapping it altogether instead of picking and choosing where it applies. “Seeing the biggest event in Scotland get a free pass will add insult to injury for the businesses struggling with the scheme.” The UK Government says it has been offering coronavirus vaccines to delegates from around the world who would otherwise not have received one. Quarantine rules will only apply to those who have visited red list countries in the 10 days before their arrival in the UK. The Scottish Government has said the initial problems with the vaccine passport app have largely been resolved.

She said: “We of course are working with UK Government, with the United Nations, in terms of the overall mitigations in place around Cop26. “There are arrangements around testing and other mitigations that those attending Cop will be required to comply with. “These are arrangements in which we are cooperating with others and I know all of us, for all sorts of reasons, want Cop26 to be a success.”"

They further suggest that simulations of the creation of the solar system show that such a planet may have been pushed from the outer regions of the solar system by the gas giants. As scientists continue to study the solar system, they are still trying to understand not only how the planets came to exist but why they occupy their current orbits. In this new effort, the authors note that simulations of the evolution of the solar system are not yet able to explain the current configuration due to missing information. And they suspect that the missing information involves a planet that once circled the sun in the outer solar system (where the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune reside) but now exists out beyond the edges of the solar system or even in deep space. The authors note that there is something odd about the current configuration of the planets, which has four inner rocky planets, an asteroid belt and then four gas giants in the outer solar system. Past the giants are dwarf planets and other objects such as comets. The researchers believe something is missing. They contend that it is unlikely that the natural evolution of our solar system would have four gas giants and then nothing but dwarfs. Logic suggests there should be some planets of other sizes, and their simulations back them up. Adding another Earth- or Mars-sized planet to the outer solar system, perhaps between two of the gas giants, produces a more accurate model—at least during the early stages of development. Eventually, such a planet would have been pushed farther out into space, either joining the dwarfs, or was driven all the way out into interstellar space, where it would travel alone. They conclude that if such a planet does exist at the outer edges of the solar system, new telescopes under construction may be able to spot it and thus confirm their theory.

Last week, he was arrested while he was doing an interview on his phone with a Persian-language broadcaster. The phone's camera was still on and captured footage of the arrest at his parents' home; you can hear his mother's voice pleading with the officers not to take her son away. However, Ghasemzadeh's hands were tied, and he was blindfolded before being whisked away. ""Union activists like Aziz Ghasemzadeh are accused of 'endangering national security.' The authorities are cracking down on them,"" human rights lawyer Saeid Dehghan told DW. ""Ghasemzadeh is a teacher and a respected musician and singer. He is an educated and cultured person who is peacefully campaigning for more social justice and better working conditions. That is not forbidden under our constitution."" Aziz Ghasemzadeh was arrested in the middle of an interview Fear of the regime Deghan, who is from the capital, Tehran, defends political prisoners in Iran. Deghan is concerned about the arbitrary arrest of activists. He says the intention is to intimidate them before they can organize themselves. ""The general discontent in Iran is very high, and any protest action has the potential to mobilize many people against the political system. That's why, from the government's point of view, any protest must be nipped in the bud."" The day before his arrest, Aziz Ghasemzadeh had addressed a protest rally just before the start of the new school year in Iran. Similar demonstrations took place in more than 40 cities. The activists were campaigning for better working conditions and higher wages for teachers who are employees of the Ministry of Education. Teachers in Iran have been campaigning for a long time for better pay Many of them have not received their salary in months. It was only in March 2021 that the previous government under President Rouhani, after long negotiations, agreed to adjust teachers' salaries in light of the country's deteriorating economic situation. ‘Fair demands' The teachers' wages were meant to be hiked by between 20% and 27%. However, the inflation rate in Iran in 2020 was 36.5% compared with the previous year. This year, it's expected to skyrocket to nearly 40%. According to Iran's statistics agency, the average cost of living increased by more than 30% last year alone. ""We are asking for our rights,"" Aziz Ghasemzadeh had stressed in his speech, which quickly circulated on the internet. The activists demanded not only fair pay but also urgent investment in modernizing dilapidated school buildings and hiring more staff. ""Political leaders believe they can solve the problem by arresting union activists. They are wrong. We will not give up,"" Ghasemzadeh said in his speech. Now he himself is among at least 15 Iranian teachers who have been put behind bars for their work in the union. One of the best-known prisoners is math teacher Esmail Abdi. Abdi, an executive board member of the Iranian Teachers' Trade Association, has been in jail since November 2016. He's been slapped with the regime's standard charge of ""gathering information with the aim of endangering national security"" and ""propaganda against the political system."" Esmail Abdi has been behind bars since 2016 Violation of international obligations The labor union Education International has repeatedly called for the release of Esmail Abdi and campaigned for global solidarity with him and other teachers imprisoned in Iran. Iran is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The treaties guarantee the right of every person to form and join trade unions of their own free will for the promotion and protection of their economic and social interests. In other words, those in power in Iran are violating their international human rights obligations. ""That's because they don't have to fear any serious consequences,"" Raha Bahreini, an Iran expert at Amnesty International, told DW. Bahreini pointed out that the UN had appointed a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, who documents human rights violations in the country. ""We're calling for an international mechanism to identify those responsible for human rights violations in Iran and to have the files opened so that those concerned can eventually be brought to justice,"" Bahreini said."

The Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, set up by the UN Human Rights Council, said migrants and detainees were particularly exposed to violations. ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes have been committed in Libya, while violence perpetrated in prisons and against migrants there may amount to crimes against humanity,"" the mission said in a statement. ""All parties to the conflicts, including third states, foreign fighters and mercenaries, have violated international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of proportionality and distinction, and some have also committed war crimes,"" said Mohamed Auajjar, who chaired the three-person mission. The report chronicles accounts of crimes like murder, torture, enslavement, extrajudicial killings and rape. All sides bear responsibility for the crimes The mission was set up after the UN's top rights body adopted a resolution in June 2020 calling for the establishment of a fact-finding group to be sent to Libya. The experts collected and reviewed hundreds of documents, interviewed over 150 people and carried out investigations in Libya, Tunisia and Italy. They said that all sides in the nation's conflict — both Libyan and foreign groups — bore responsibility for the atrocities and crimes. The UN body said it had drawn up a confidential list of suspects, details of which would not be revealed until they could be shared with appropriate accountability mechanisms. Violations are committed ""on a widespread scale"" by state and non-state actors, ""with a high level of organization and with the encouragement of the state — all of which is suggestive of crimes against humanity,"" the report said. It added that migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe were subjected to a range of abuses in detention centers and at the hands of traffickers. What's the current situation in Libya? Libya has been in a state of turmoil since the 2011 ouster and killing of dictator Moammar Ghadafi in a NATO-backed uprising. Since then, rival administrations in the east and west of the country have been vying for power. Regional powers, foreign fighters and mercenaries have also been involved in the conflict. Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates backed the eastern forces, while Turkey backed the government in the west. The political unrest and violence in the oil-rich northern African nation has hit the lives of Libyans hard. But major fighting has paused since last year after both sides agreed to a cease-fire and to form a unity interim government. An election is planned for December. sri/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters)"

It did not say how the files were obtained, and Reuters could not independently verify the reports or the documents detailed by the consortium. The use of off-shore companies is not illegal or by itself evidence of wrongdoing, but news organisations in the consortium said such transactions could be used to hide wealth from tax collectors and other authorities. Jordan's King Abdullah, a close US ally, was reported to have used offshore accounts to spend more than $100 million on luxury homes in the United Kingdom and the United States.

""There is nothing I have to hide from anyone but we are stronger than this and this is not the first time people target Jordan,"" the monarch told the gathering. DLA Piper, a London law office representing Mr Abdullah, told the consortium of media outlets that he had ""not at any point misused public monies or made any use whatsoever of the proceeds of aid or assistance intended for public use."" The Washington Post, which is part of the consortium, also reported on the case of Svetlana Krivonogikh, a Russian woman who it said became the owner of a Monaco apartment through an offshore company incorporated on the Caribbean island of Tortola in April 2003 just weeks after she gave birth to a girl. At the time, she was in a secret, years-long relationship with Mr Putin, the newspaper said, citing Russian investigative outlet Proekt. The Post said Ms Krivonogikh and her daughter, who is now 18, did not respond to requests for comment. The Kremlin said it had seen no evidence in the leak of hidden wealth among Mr Putin's inner circle.

A statement by his office said he had taken part in founding the company in 2015 and owned 17 shares, but that the firm had no activity since then and he had resigned and sold his stake. The Indian Express, part of the consortium, said the documents also showed that businessman Anil Ambani and his representatives owned at least 18 offshore companies in Jersey, the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus. Set up between 2007 and 2010, seven of these companies had borrowed and invested at least $1.3 billion, the report said.

The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists involved 600 journalists from 150 media outlets in 117 countries. It’s being dubbed the “Pandora Papers” because the findings shed light on the previously hidden dealings of the elite and the corrupt. Hundreds of politicians, celebrities, religious leaders and drug dealers have been hiding their investments in mansions, exclusive beachfront property, yachts and other assets, according to a review of nearly 12 million files obtained from 14 firms located around the world. The more than 330 current and former politicians identified as beneficiaries of the secret accounts include Jordan’s King Abdullah II, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso, and associates of both Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The billionaires called out in the report include Turkish construction mogul Erman Ilicak and Robert T. Brockman, the former CEO of software maker Reynolds & Reynolds. Many of the accounts were designed to evade taxes and conceal assets for other shady reasons, according to the report. “The new data leak must be a wake-up call,” said Sven Giegold, a Green party lawmaker in the European Parliament. “Global tax evasion fuels global inequality. We need to expand and sharpen the countermeasures now.” Oxfam International, a British consortium of charities, applauded the Pandora Papers for exposing brazen examples of greed that deprived countries of tax revenue that could be used to finance programs and projects for the greater good. “This is where our missing hospitals are,"" Oxfam said in a statement. “This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is ‘no money’ to pay for climate damage and innovation, for more and better jobs, for a fair post-COVID recovery, for more overseas aid, they know where to look."" The Pandora Papers are a follow-up to a similar project released in 2016 called the “Panama Papers"" compiled by the same journalistic group. The latest bombshell is even more expansive, relying on nearly 3 terabytes of data — the equivalent of roughly 750,000 photos on a smartphone — leaked from 14 different service providers doing business in 38 different jurisdictions in the world. The records date back to the 1970s, but most of the files span from 1996 to 2020. In contrast, the Panama Papers culled through 2.6 terabytes of data leaked by one now-defunct law firm called Mossack Fonseca that was located in the country that inspired that project's nickname. The latest investigation dug into accounts registered in familiar offshore havens, including the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles, Hong Kong and Belize. But some of the secret accounts were also scattered around in trusts set up in the U.S., including 81 in South Dakota and 37 in Florida. The investigation found advisers helped Abdullah, the king of Jordan, set up at least three dozen shell companies from 1995 to 2017, helping the monarch buy 14 homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. One was a $23 million California ocean-view property bought in 2017 through a British Virgin Islands company. The advisers were identified as an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands. Abdullah denied any impropriety in a comment Monday by the Royal Palace, citing security needs for keeping the transactions quiet and saying no public funds were used. The details are an embarrassing blow to Abdullah, whose government was engulfed in scandal this year when his half brother, former Crown Prince Hamzah, accused the “ruling system” of corruption and incompetence. The king claimed he was the victim of a “malicious plot,” placed his half brother under house arrest and put two former close aides on trial. U.K attorneys for Abdullah said he isn’t required to pay taxes under his country’s law and hasn’t misused public funds. The attorneys also said most of the companies and properties are not connected to the king or no longer exist, though they declined to provide details. Blair, U.K. prime minister from 1997 to 2007, became the owner of an $8.8 million Victorian building in 2017 by buying a British Virgin Islands company that held the property, and the building now hosts the law firm of his wife, Cherie Blair, according to the the investigation. The two bought the company from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister, Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani. Buying the company shares instead of the London building saved the Blairs more than $400,000 in property taxes, the investigation found. The Blairs and the al-Zayanis both said they didn’t initially know the other party was involved in the deal, the probe found. Cherie Blair said her husband wasn’t involved in the purchase, which she said was meant to bring “the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.” She also said she did not want to own a British Virgin Islands company and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company,” which is now closed. A lawyer for the al-Zayanis said they complied with U.K. laws. Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, is not accused of any wrongdoing. But members of his inner circle, including Finance Minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, are accused of hiding millions of dollars in wealth in secret companies or trusts, according to the journalists' findings. In a tweet, Khan vowed to recover the “ill-gotten gains” and said his government will look into all citizens mentioned in the documents and take action, if needed. The consortium of journalists revealed Putin's image-maker and chief executive of Russia's leading TV station, Konstantin Ernst, got a discount to buy and develop Soviet-era cinemas and surrounding property in Moscow after he directed the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Ernst told the organization the deal wasn't secret and denied suggestions he was given special treatment. In 2009, Babis, the Czech prime minister, put $22 million into shell companies to buy a chateau property in a hilltop village in Mougins, France, near Cannes, the investigation found. The shell companies and the chateau were not disclosed in Babis’ required asset declarations, according to documents obtained by the journalism group’s Czech partner, Investigace.cz. A real estate group owned indirectly by Babis bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau in 2018, the probe found. Babis has denied any wrongdoing. “I don’t own any offshore, I don’t own any property in France, and all the money I loaned then I got back,” he told the Czech public television on Monday. “Let the police investigate that.” Babis said the report was meant to harm him ahead of the Czech Republic parliamentary election being held on Friday and Saturday. “It’s nasty, false accusations that are meant to influence the election. That’s all,” he said. The Czech police’s organized crime unit said it would launch an investigation into the report. ——— Liedtke reported from San Ramon, California, and Mattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

(Representational) Panama fears the publication Sunday of a new expose about financial secrecy in global tax havens could again taint its reputation, which was seriously damaged by the ""Panama Papers"" scandal, according to a government letter released by local media. ""The damage could be insurmountable,"" the Panamanian government said in the letter, sent through a law firm to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The letter warns that ""any publication"" reinforcing ""a false perception"" of the country as a possible tax haven ""will have devastating consequences for Panama and its people."" The ICIJ tweeted that it would release Sunday 1630 GMT its ""most expansive expose of financial secrecy yet,"" based on the leak of 11.9 million documents ""covering every corner of the globe."" The ""Pandora Papers"" investigation is the result of work by more than 600 reporters in 117 countries, the ICIJ said. The letter from the Panamanian government also references some of the reforms that the Central American country has made in recent years, although it remains on the EU list of tax havens. It also indicates that since 2016 the registration of more than 395,000 companies and foundations has been suspended, around half of those existing at that time. The government fears that Panama will again be the epicenter of a new global tax havens scandal like the one that followed the ICIJ's disclosure of the ""Panama Papers"" in 2016. That massive data leak exposed widespread tax avoidance and evasion using complex structures of offshore shell companies and caused an international outcry. The leak, linked to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, damaged Panama's international image, despite the fact that most of the companies involved were overseas. The investigation revealed the concealment of properties, companies, assets, profits and tax evasion by heads of state and government, political leaders and personalities from finance, sports and the arts. Since then, Panama has carried out various legal reforms to strengthen banking controls and penalize tax evasion with jail time. The Panama of 2016 ""is nothing like the Panama of today,"" the government said in its letter.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a cautious plan to ease lockdown restrictions in Auckland, despite an outbreak there that continues to simmer. Since early in the pandemic, New Zealand had pursued an unusual zero-tolerance approach to the virus through strict lockdowns and aggressive contact tracing. Until recently, that elimination strategy had worked remarkably well for the country of 5 million, which has reported just 27 virus deaths. While other nations faced rising death tolls and disrupted lives, New Zealanders went back to workplaces, school yards and sports stadiums safe from any community spread. But that all changed when the more contagious delta variant somehow escaped from a quarantine facility in August after it was brought into the country from a traveler returning from Australia. Despite New Zealand going into the strictest form of lockdown after just a single local case was detected, it ultimately wasn't enough to crush the outbreak entirely. One factor may have been that the disease spread among some groups that are typically more wary of authorities, including gang members and homeless people living in transitional housing. The outbreak has grown to more than 1,300 cases, with 29 more detected on Monday. A few cases have been found outside of Auckland. Ardern said that seven weeks of lockdown restrictions in Auckland had helped keep the outbreak under control. ""For this outbreak, it’s clear that long periods of heavy restrictions has not got us to zero cases,” Ardern said. “But that is OK. Elimination was important because we didn’t have vaccines. Now we do, so we can begin to change the way we do things.” New Zealand began its vaccination campaign slowly compared to most other developed nations. Rates rocketed in August after the outbreak began but have dropped off significantly again since then. About 65% of New Zealanders have had at least one dose and 40% are fully vaccinated. Among people age 12 and older, about 79% have had at least a single jab. Under Ardern's plan that starts Tuesday, Aucklanders will be able to meet outdoors with loved ones from one other household, early childhood centers will reopen and people will be able to relax at the beach. The dates for a phased reopening of retail stores and later bars and restaurants have yet to be decided. Ardern said the elimination strategy had served the country incredibly well but the government always intended to eventually transition to the protection of vaccines, a change hastened by the delta variant “game changer.” The government's elimination approach had been broadly supported by New Zealanders but was facing increasing criticism. Over the weekend, hundreds of people turned out to rallies protesting the lockdown. Opposition lawmaker Chris Bishop said the government had no clear strategy to deal with the outbreak other than total surrender. But Ardern said that most measures would remain in place to keep the outbreak under control, including exhaustive contact tracing and isolating those who got infected. “There’s good cause for us to feel optimistic about the future,” Ardern said. “But we cannot rush.”"

The European Medicines Agency’s medicines committee said the recommendation was based on data from a study of 18 to 55-year-olds, showing an increase in antibodies after a third shot. Data has shown that immunity wanes with the vaccines currently in use, and appears to wane more quickly with the BioNTech/Pfizer jab. The EMA also said that people with severely weakened immune systems may be given a booster dose of either the BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna jabs just 28 days after their second dose. While there is no direct evidence linking antibody levels to stronger protection in those with weakened immune systems, “it is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,” the EMA said. Many EU countries have already begun administering booster doses to people with weakened immune systems — due to medication they are taking or disease — jumping the gun on the EMA’s decision. But fewer countries, among them Hungary, have been administering boosters to all adults. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has recommended boosters only for those aged 65 and over; people at high risk of severe COVID-19; and people whose jobs put them at higher risk of complications from the virus — holding off from backing a third shot for all adults. In its announcement Monday, the EU regulator warned that the risk of inflammatory heart conditions — observed after the BioNTech/Pfizer jab — or other very rare side effects after a booster was not yet known and “is being carefully monitored.” Widest indication For EU politicians faced with calls from citizens for boosters ahead of the coming winter, it will come as some relief to have the full backing of Europe’s drugs regulator, known for the high caliber of its scientific reviews. Many countries, including France and Germany, have so far restricted third doses to vulnerable people and those with weakened immune systems. The EMA’s support for the widest possible booster indication with the Pfizer jab — for all over-18s after at least six months — provides countries with the flexibility to expand their programs in the knowledge that doing so is supported by the science. For German MEP Peter Liese, EPP’s health spokesperson, however, delivering boosters to healthy people falls behind the dire need first vaccinate all eligible citizens. “... We must not forget that still a third of the population, including many over 16, for whom the vaccination has been approved and recommended since the end of last year, is not vaccinated,” he said in a statement. “We must therefore continue to do everything together to convince people of the benefits of vaccination and to make low-threshold offers,” he said. Liese, meanwhile, noted that immunocompromised people should “promptly” receive a booster dose, to “greatly minimize” the risk of dying. EU backing could also be linked to the widening of health passes for three doses for travel in the future, pointed out Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. “While vaccine passports in various forms are being hotly debated in the U.K., we risk ignoring the need for booster jabs,” he said. The U.K. has initiated a booster program for the over-50s, vulnerable people and people who work in front-line health and social care settings. “If they become commonplace in the European Union, they may end up being required for travel and will become necessary almost by default,” he added. The green light for third shots in the EU is unlikely to be met with support from the World Health Organization. Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called for a moratorium on boosters for healthy people until 40 percent of every country's population is vaccinated, a target the WHO hopes to hit by the end of this year. It aims to vaccinate 70 people of all populations by the middle of next year. During a journalists’ briefing last month, Tedros said that globally, “5.5 billion vaccine doses have now been administered, but 80 percent have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries.” Meanwhile, doses promised to COVAX, the global vaccines distribution scheme, have failed to deliver. Of the 1 billion doses promised, fewer than 15 percent have materialized, he said last month. Until the WHO's targets are met, “we do not want to see widespread use of boosters for healthy people who are fully vaccinated,” Tedros said. Currently, the EMA has made a decision only on the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine booster for healthy people. But a similar decision on Moderna’s jab should not be far off; the company filed its application towards the end of last month. This article has been updated."

Tax authorities in Australia and the U.K. have already confirmed they will analyze the trove of secret documents released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to see if there is any evidence that wealthy individuals named in the papers broke local tax law. Alongside the billionaires and world leaders current and former named in the data dump of more than 11.9 million records — including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, King Abdullah of Jordan and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis — the names of several celebrities turned up. ICIJ journalists allege that Shakira, Elton John, Ringo Starr and Claudia Schiffer all set up PO Box companies in known tax havens, such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama or the Bahamas, a setup often used to hide money from tax authorities. The news outlets that published the Pandora Papers revelations — a global consortium that includes The Washington Post, British newspaper The Guardian, Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung and El Pais in Spain — do not accuse those names in the documents of having violated any laws. An attorney for Shakira told the ICIJ that the Colombian singer denies all wrongdoings, saying she had declared her companies in the Bahamas claiming they do not provide tax advantages. Representatives for Schiffer also claim the fashion star pays her taxes in the U.K., where she is based. Shakira is facing a possible tax fraud case in Spain after a Spanish judge recommended in July that the singer face a trial over allegations she failed to pay €14.5 million ($16.84 million) in tax on income earned between 2012 and 2014. The case centers on allegations that Shakira lived in Spain during the period, although she was registered for tax purposes in the Bahamas. On Monday, Shakira’s lawyers said a Spanish court was likely to rule in favor of the singer, though court officials were not immediately available for comment. The Pandora Papers are a follow-up to a similar project in 2016 from the same journalist collective called the Panama Papers. The Panama Papers, however, were based on a data leak from a single, now-defunct, law firm called Mossack Fonseca located in Panama. Some of the Panama Papers revelations were used as the basis of Steven Soderbergh’s Netflix satire The Laundromat, starring Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as Mossack Fonseca co-founders Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca. The latest data dump is even larger than the Panama Papers and comes from documents leaked from some 14 different service providers doing business in 38 different jurisdictions worldwide. Some of the records date back to the 1970s, but most of the files are from 1996 to 2020. On Monday, the U.K. chancellor, or finance minister, Rishi Sunak told Sky News the country’s tax authorities would review the leaked information and documents “to see if there is anything we can learn.” Asked in a BBC radio interview if he was ashamed that London is sometimes seen as a place for rich people looking to get out of paying their fair share of taxes, Sunak, a member of the ruling Conservative Party, said: “I don’t think it is a source of shame because actually, our track record on this is very strong,” adding, “there is a global dimension to it, and we need other countries to co-operate with us to tackle this, but we are determined to do that.” Political London also discussed the news from the leak that former Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie avoided paying £312,000 ($423,000) in tax when they purchased a £6.45 million ($8.74 million) London townhouse in 2017 by buying the offshore company that owned it. On the other side of the world, the Australia Tax Office said on Monday that it would also be analyzing the information in the Pandora Papers “to identify any possible Australian links.” Georg Szalai contributed to this report."

Rising demand for its beautiful wood, lax local law enforcement, and civil strife have accelerated logging while hindering conservation efforts. Conservationists want zebrawood to be placed on a CITES list and for the forest — also home to endangered gorillas, chimpanzees and red colobus monkeys — to be declared a national park. When a towering African zebrawood tree falls in the forest, it certainly makes a sound. During a survey of the Ebo forest from August 2020 to March 2021, Eric Nana and his team from Cameroon’s Agricultural Research Institute for Development (IRAD) witnessed the destruction caused whenever one of these forest giants, supported with huge buttress roots and crowned with feathery leaves, is felled. “Some have been there for hundreds of years,” Nana said. “Cutting down just a single tree destroys all the smaller trees around it. It considerably opens up the forest, and enables all the undergrowth species to come up. Growth from other forest tree species becomes difficult.” A brief report on the IRAD survey, published in September in the journal Oryx, estimates that at least two metric tons of wood from this now-rare species — listed as critically endangered by the IUCN — is being illegally removed from the Ebo forest each month. That’s equivalent to two or three large trees, Nana told Mongabay: a heavy toll on a slow-maturing species that is already scarce. “Chinese merchants [in the port city of Douala] pay people to go into the forest, harvest the tree and bring it back to them,” said Nana, who led the survey to assess the status of African zebrawood (Microberlinia bisulcata) and other threatened species in the forest, which covers an area of around 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles). The price of a cubic meter (equivalent to 1 metric ton) has risen to $600, from around $300 in 2018. Loggers are paid up to 100,000 CFA francs (around $180) per tree. The illegal loggers only saw off around 40-50% of each tree they fell, leaving the rest to rot. “It’s just a huge waste,” Nana said. “All standing trees we identified last year have been cut.” Rising demand for its beautiful wood, lax local law enforcement, and civil strife are pushing the critically endangered African zebrawood tree toward extinction in Cameroon’s forests, conservationists say. Nana said zebrawood is used to make high-value furniture. The trees — whose pale and dark wood grains resemble the patterns on a zebra hide — are only found in fragmented pockets in southwestern Cameroon, including in and around the Ebo forest, in the country’s southern Littoral region. But delays to plans to turn the critical gorilla and chimpanzee refuge into a national park are fueling the tree’s illegal extraction. The forest is home to endangered primates, including western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and Preuss’s red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus preussi). The survey found that locals were deeply involved in the illegal harvest and trade. On one occasion, a government official, known locally as a sous-préfet, was witnessed sending out harvesters to cut down zebrawood. “When they saw us, they thought at first we were police agents coming to control them,” Nana said. He added the official was relieved when they assured him they weren’t. “He made a call in front of us, telling those loggers in the forest that, ‘These guys are not police agents, they’re just researchers.’ “The whole value chain goes from harvesters right up to people in government,” Nana said. “Without the support of locals wanting to curb it, it will be difficult to stop.” He and his team recommend that zebrawood be added to a CITES list to prevent its illegal trade. This will also pressure the government into protecting it, he said. IRAD, a government research institute, and the National Herbarium of Cameroon have established nurseries around the Ebo forest to grow zebrawood seedlings. So far 4,000 have been produced — an insurance policy in case all the seed-bearing trees are wiped out. Mixed signals from the government For at least 20 years, there have been plans to turn most of the Ebo forest into a national park. But Cameroon’s government has also granted various permits for logging and the creation of oil palm plantations around the forest. In 2020, a logging concession inside Ebo was granted — and then suspended following an outcry from local and international conservation groups. But illegal logging continues, and formal logging has been permitted along Ebo’s northern border by Cameroon’s Ministry of Forests and Wildlife, according to two official notices seen by Mongabay. One of the new logging areas is adjacent to gorilla habitat, said Ekwoge Abwe, of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance’s African forest program. “The new strategy is to allocate smaller parcels [known as ventes de coupes] in and around the forest for logging,” Abwe said. Abwe’s Ebo Forest Research Project has been working in the area since 2002, when gorillas were discovered in the north of the forest. The project works with more than 40 communities living around Ebo, as well as grassroots conservation groups like Club des Amis de Gorilles (Gorilla Guardian Club) trying to protect its biodiversity. “We notice illegal logging activity not only of zebrawood, but other species as well,” Abwe said. “The wood is sawn into planks for easier transportation. The illegal logging is facilitated by the fact that the western and southern parts of the forest were logged about three decades ago. The logging roads and trails ease access [for today’s] illegal loggers.” Six years ago, Abwe carried out a survey to assess, among other things, the availability of fruit-bearing trees for the forest’s chimpanzee population. Though the survey wasn’t aimed at finding African zebrawood specifically, it did produce a useful database that suggests the species does not grow in the north, which is more mountainous, but does grow in the lower-lying south and west: the same areas being targeted today by illegal logging. “It is likely that the species has a limited distribution even within the forest,” Abwe said. “Ebo could be its last stronghold and hope.” Limbi Blessing Tata is executive director of Ecological Balance Cameroon, an environmental nonprofit based in Buea, a city on the slopes of Mount Cameroon in the country’s Southwest region. In 2015, Tata, a trained botanist, led a project to conserve African zebrawood trees in the region’s Mokoko Forest Reserve. At the time there were 900 seed-bearing zebrawoods growing there. Workshops were held with locals to teach them about the importance of preserving the trees, and a network of informants (she called it the “CIA of the forest”) was set up to warn of any threats facing them. “But allowing locals to derive value from non-timber products will be vital to preserving it in the future,” she said. Tata said Korup National Park is another stronghold of the African zebrawood in the region. But the country’s four-year-long Anglophone crisis, pitting rebels against government forces in the Southwest and Northwest regions, has meant Korup and Mokoko are now “no-go areas” for conservationists. “As we speak, one of two things has happened,” she said. “Either the crisis has scared loggers and the species is thriving, or the remaining mature trees which served as the seed banks have been destroyed.” Additional listening from Mongabay’s podcast: A conversation with the head of the Ebo Forest Research Project about efforts to safeguard the area, listen here: Citations Nana, E.

Amid surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, which trap and concentrate heat, and little vegetation, temperatures are generally higher in urban areas.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/04/nearly-25-of-world-population-exposed-to-deadly-city-heat",99,"theguardian","Nearly 25% of world population exposed to deadly city heat","2021-10-04 00:00:00-05","Exposure to deadly urban heat has tripled since the 1980s, and now affects nearly a quarter of the world’s population, a study has found. Scientists put the worrying trend down to the combination of rising temperatures and growing numbers of people living in urban areas, and warned of its potentially fatal impact. In recent decades, hundreds of millions of people have moved from rural areas to cities, which are now home to more than half the world’s population. Amid surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, which trap and concentrate heat, and little vegetation, temperatures are generally higher in urban areas. “This has broad effects,” said Cascade Tuholske, the lead author of the study published in the journal PNAS and a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University’s Earth Institute. “It increases morbidity and mortality. It impacts people’s ability to work, and results in lower economic output. It exacerbates pre-existing health conditions.” The study used infrared satellite imagery and maximum daily heat and humidity readings from more than 13,000 cities from 1983 to 2016 to determine the number of people exposed to the days a year that exceeded 30C (86F) on the wet-bulb globe temperature scale (which takes into account the multiplier effect of high humidity) in an area. They matched the findings with the cities’ populations over the same period. The study found that the number of person-days (the cumulative population exposed to cumulative heat in a given year for a particular place) soared from 40bn a year in 1983 to 119bn in 2016, representing a threefold increase. In 2016, 1.7 billion people were subjected to extreme heat conditions on multiple days. Although it varied between cities and regions, scientists attributed two-thirds of the overall rise in exposure to increased urban populations and a third of it to global heating. The worst affected city was Dhaka. Between 1983 and 2016, during which time the city’s population rose dramatically, Bangladesh’s capital experienced an increase of 575 million person-days of extreme heat. Other cities that underwent rapid population growth include Shanghai and Guangzhou in China, Yangon in Myanmar, Bangkok in Thailand and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Cities that had at least half of their heat exposure caused by global heating include Baghdad in Iraq, Cairo in Egypt and Mumbai in India. Of the cities studied, 17% experienced an additional month of extreme-heat days during the period, which spanned just over three decades. Tuholske said: “A lot of these cities show the pattern of how human civilization has evolved over the past 15,000 years. The Nile, the Tigris-Euphrates, the Ganges … there is a pattern to the places where we wanted to be. Now, those areas may become uninhabitable. Are people really going to want to live there?”  Meanwhile in the US about 40 large cities have had rapidly growing exposure to heat, including Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin in Texas, Pensacola in Florida, Las Vegas in Nevada, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles in Louisiana and Providence in Rhode Island. The PNAS paper is one of a number of newly published studies examining the impact of extreme heat. A Brazilian study analysing the impact of forest loss on human health found that by 2100 as many as 12 million Brazilians could be exposed to extreme risk of heat stress as a result of large-scale deforestation of the Amazon and climate change. The research, published in the Communications Earth & Environment journal on Friday, found there was a deforestation threshold in the Amazon that could threaten human survival if breached. Meanwhile, a European study released on Monday predicts the economic costs of heatwaves could increase by nearly five times by 2060. Scientists from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and other institutions estimate that recent heatwaves have led to an annual loss of 0.3-0.5% of European gross domestic product, losses they project will grow steadily over the next 40 years. By the 2060s, they predict heatwaves will increase to an annual average of 1.14% and southern European countries will face the highest economic losses."

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Related documents MTD opinion View Amended complaint View MTD View (Reuters) - A $300 ""red herring"" failed to sway a Manhattan federal judge last week. U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which the family of an American teenager claims two Russian banks enabled a Russian supremacist group to shoot down a Malaysia Airlines plane over Ukraine in 2014. The Antiterrorism Act, as you know, establishes a cause of action for U.S. citizens against banks that provide material support to terror groups. But ATA plaintiffs still have to show that U.S. courts have jurisdiction to hear their claims. That was a key issue in the lawsuit by the parents and sister of Quinn Schansman, who was 18 years old and traveling to a family vacation when he died aboard the Malaysian jet. In an amended complaint filed last October, Schansman's family alleged that two Russian banks – Sberbank of Russia PJSC and VTB Bank PJSC – funneled millions of dollars to the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian separatist group allegedly responsible for shooting down the Malaysain Air jet. The amended complaint asserted that New York had jurisdiction over the family’s case because Sberbank and VTB routinely and deliberately routed transfers to the separatist group through their New York-based correspondent accounts at U.S. banks. The family’s lawyers at Jenner & Block were able to document two of those transactions in the amended complaint by obtaining early discovery from a court-ordered subpoena served on two of those U.S. banks, Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon. The partial records from just those two banks, Jenner alleged, showed that Sberbank used U.S. banks to transfer donations to the Russian supremacist group. It’s unusual for ATA plaintiffs to assert specific details about transactions in their complaints because such allegations can only be based on internal bank records – and plaintiffs don’t typically have early access to those documents. (The magistrate judge in the Schansman case authorized subpoenas to BofA and BNY Mellon when the U.S. banks said they would not voluntarily preserve evidence without a subpoena.) The Schansmans’ amended complaint claimed that the two documented money transfers were just the tip of an iceberg of transactions in which millions of dollars flowed to the alleged Russian terror group through U.S. accounts belonging to Sberbank and VTB. Fundraisers for the group, Jenner & Block alleged, confirmed the money flow through detailed financial ledgers that they posted online. That public evidence, the complaint said, was ample justification for New York’s jurisdiction over the Russian banks. But the banks’ lawyers tried to use the very specificity of the Schansmans’ allegations to defeat the family’s claims of jurisdiction. In dismissal motions from Sberbank’s lawyers at Debevoise & Plimpton and VTB’s counsel at Latham & Watkins, the banks argued that the family’s early discovery actually showed the weakness of the Schansmans’ jurisdictional case. Those two documented transactions through Sberbank’s account at Bank of America, they said, totaled a measly $300. Two transfers adding up to $300, the Russian banks argued, were hardly convincing evidence that the banks deliberately and repeatedly used the U.S. banking system, as required to establish New York's jurisdiction. “Plaintiffs’ identification of only two mechanical transfers totaling $300 through Sberbank correspondent accounts,” Debevoise wrote in Sberbank’s dismissal motion, “is too inconsequential to support personal jurisdiction over Sberbank in New York.” Jenner & Block called the size of the two documented transfers a red herring in its brief opposing the banks' dismissal motions. Those two transactions, Jenner argued, were merely what plaintiffs' lawyers were able to document from incomplete records produced from just two of the U.S. banks where Sberbank and VTB held accounts. Other U.S. banks processed more and bigger transfers, the brief said. Moreover, Jenner argued, key precedent from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does not require ATA plaintiffs to identify any specific transactions to establish jurisdiction, much less to pinpoint particularly large transfers through U.S. banks. The appellate court's 2013 ruling in Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank only requires plaintiffs to allege that defendants systematically relied on U.S. banks, Jenner contended. The Schansman’s allegations, Jenner said, far exceeded Licci’s requirements. In last week’s decision, Carter agreed. ATA plaintiffs, he said, do not have to allege details about individual transfers to establish the personal jurisdiction of New York courts. Plaintiffs must simply show that defendants repeatedly and deliberately used New York’s banking system to transfer funds that allegedly supported terror operations. The Schansmans, Carter said, met that test by alleging that the Russian supremacist group instructed donors to send money through the Russian banks’ U.S. correspondent accounts. I emailed Sberbank’s Debevoise lawyers and VTB’s Latham counsel for comment but didn’t hear back. The Schansmans’ lead counsel, David Pressman of Jenner, said that the banks’ focus on the small size of the two document transactions was “a distraction, and the court refused to be distracted.” His clients’ complaint, he said, was uniquely detailed for an ATA suit, thanks both to the partial records obtained from BofA and BNY Mellon and to the Russian separatist group’s online posts about its fundraising – including instructions to use U.S. accounts belonging to Sberbank and VTB – and spending on weaponry. If those allegations had been deemed insufficient to establish New York’s jurisdiction, Pressman said, no plaintiff could withstand a dismissal motion without bank defendants’ own internal records. “That is not what Congress intended when it enacted the Antiterrorism Act,” said Pressman, who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Security Council, in a follow-up email. “It is not what logic demands. And it would forever immunize big banks from liability for involvement in heinous acts such as those that killed Quinn.” Opinions expressed here are those of the author.

REUTERS/Damir Sagolj MANILA, Oct 4 (Reuters) - An initial investigation by the Philippine government has found 154 police officers could be criminally liable over their conduct in President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody war on drugs, in a rare admission by the state that abuses may have taken place. The findings, announced by the Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Sunday, come just a few weeks after the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved a formal investigation into thousands of state killings of alleged drug dealers since Duterte took office in 2016. The government had said it will not cooperate with an international probe because the Philippines has a justice system that is functioning. The popular Duterte, 76, has dared the ICC to put him on trial and publicly said he would happily ""rot in jail"" for killing people intent on destroying his country. Duterte is stepping down as president in 2022, and political analysts expect him to anoint a successor who could insulate him from potential legal action at home or by the ICC, once he is out of power. In a late night address on Monday, Duterte said he would wait for thecases to be filed against him, even as he insisted the ICC has no right to meddle in the country's affairs. ""I will prepare for my defence,"" Duterte said. ""That ICC, just don't lie,"" he said. Activists say systematic cover-ups and executions of thousands of users and pushers have not been prosecuted. Police have denied wrongdoing and say the killings were in self-defence. ""The police officers involved in these cases were not only administratively liable. The existing evidence pointed to their possible criminal liability as well,"" Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters, without elaborating. The review, according to the government, was part of Duterte's commitment before the United Nations General Assembly that police responsible for murder would be held accountable. The police and justice ministry reviewed 52 cases where suspects were killed in what police recorded as anti-narcotics operations. Those would be sent to state investigators for further action, Guevarra said. He said 100 more cases would be looked at, which were pending preliminary investigation or under court trial. Officially, 6,200 drug suspects were killed in what police said were sting operations where suspects resisted arrest. Activists say many thousands more people, mostly users or small-time dealers, were killed in slum communities by mystery gunmen. Police have denied involvement in those deaths.

Starting Friday, according to the Taiwan Ministry of Defense, China’s People’s Liberation Army flew 38 aircraft near southwest Taiwan. The country flew 39 more planes on Saturday and 16 the next day. The US State Department released a statement warning China on Sunday against the “provocative military activity,” calling it “destabilizing.” “The United States is very concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilizing, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. “We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan.” “We have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability, and we will maintain our commitments as outlined in the Three Communiqués, the Taiwan Relations Act, and the Six Assurances.” The US State Department released a statement warning China against the “provocative military activity,” calling it “destabilizing.” Sipa USA via AP Price added that the US’s commitment to Taiwan is “rock solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.” “We will continue to stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values and deepen our ties with democratic Taiwan.” Shortly after the State Department’s statement was released, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense claimed another 52 Chinese military aircraft flew into its air defense zone, the most in one day. China is said to have flown around 145 flights near or in Taiwan’s airspace over the last four days. China is said to have flown around 145 flights near or in Taiwan’s airspace over the last four days. Taiwan Ministry of National Defense/EPA The aircraft include Shenyang J-16 fighter jets, Sukhoi SU-30 fighter jets and Xian H-6 twin-engine bombers. Also deployed were Shaanxi Y-8 ASW turbo transport submarine hunters and a Shaanxi KJ-500 early warning aircraft. Amid the flyover missions, Chinese state media issued several threats toward Taiwan and its ally Australia, questioning whether the nation will join Taiwan in becoming “cannon fodder,” after Taiwan’s foreign minister requested help from the Oceanic country. China’s Global Times newspaper tweeted the warning on Monday. “Since Taiwan authorities are preparing for war, let’s see whether Australia is willing to accompany Taiwan separatist regime to become cannon fodder,” the account wrote. State Department spokesperson Ned Price reaffirmed that the US commitment to Taiwan is “rock solid.” AP Hu Zijin, editor for the Global Times, also tweeted that it is “only a matter of time before Taiwan’s separatist authorities fall,” praising the weekend’s military flights. In response to China’s flyover missions, Taipei scrambled its own aircraft, issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems. While the US does not treat Taiwan as an entirely independent nation, it has come to its defense over Chinese attempts to claim the sovereign nation. According to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the US is obligated to preserve the “human rights of the people of Taiwan” and provide and support defense against China. In recent months, China has threatened other countries against joining the US in that pledge."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office has sought to justify his use of offshore companies as protecting him against pro-Russian forces, following leaked revelations in the Pandora Papers. A former comedian, Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 on promises to fight corruption and reduce the influence of oligarchs in the ex-Soviet country. But the files obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and published on Sunday claimed that Zelenskyy and his partners established a network of offshore companies back in 2012. The Pandora Papers are based on documents leaked to the ICIJ and exposed the offshore dealings of kings, presidents and prime ministers, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. According to its findings, two of the offshore companies belonging to Zelenskyy’s partners were used to buy three lavish properties in central London. The report also found that Zelenskyy, just before he was elected, transferred his stake in one of the offshore companies to his top aide Serhiy Shefir – the target of a shooting attack last month. An adviser to Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said on Monday that the president had created the offshore companies to “protect” the group’s incomes against the “aggressive actions” of the “corrupt” government of then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. “Journalists have de facto confirmed the president’s absolute respect for the standards of anti-corruption legislation,” Mykhailo Podoliak told the AFP news agency. Podoliak, however, did not comment on the details of other revelations from the investigation, which said that the president’s wife has continued to receive dividends from an offshore company. Supporters of another ex-president, Petro Poroshenko – a billionaire defeated by Zelenskyy in 2019 and who also appeared in an earlier investigation into offshore companies – accused Zelenskyy of tax evasion. “He and his accomplices took funds offshore without paying any taxes to the Ukrainian budget,” Iryna Gerashchenko, a lawmaker from Poroshenko’s faction, wrote on Facebook.   Before becoming president, Zelenskyy played a history teacher in a comedy series who was elected president after denouncing endemic corruption. In his election campaign, he cultivated an image of a leader seeking to “break the system” and promised a fierce fight against corruption in one of Europe’s poorest countries. The Pandora Papers are the latest in a series of mass ICIJ leaks of financial documents, from LuxLeaks in 2014, to the 2016 Panama Papers, which triggered the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and paved the way for the forced resignation of the leader of Pakistan. They were followed by the Paradise Papers in 2017 and FinCen files in 2020."

The U.K. will reserve a key role for nuclear power in the nation’s electricity system as a backup for renewables in a plan to phase out natural gas by 2035. Fossil fuels will no longer be used to generate power by the middle of the next decade as the U.K. tackles the double threat of climate change and an energy supply crunch that has sent prices spiraling to record highs. The government says the plan is “a landmark move to end Britain’s dependency on volatile fossil fuels.” The size of the task is huge. The U.K. remains heavily reliant on gas with 38% of electricity demand being met by the fuel. The government says that nuclear is a key part of reaching net zero but plans to get new projects built have been slow with financing a sticking point. Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed in December to supporting at least one large-scale nuclear project by 2025 and has been in talks with Electricite de France SA for almost 10 months trying to hammer out a deal. “The more I look at this, I think nuclear has to be part of the solution,” Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. “What we need to do in this country is have a cheap, affordable system, something that’s sustainable, and something which we can rely on ourselves, which protects us from the vagaries of international price movements.” The U.K. was successful in cutting emissions with a bold move to phase out coal by 2024. That spurred investment in clean sources of power and more than half of the electricity now comes from low-carbon sources. The nation relies on gas particularly in winter when demand is higher and to turn up and down to meet intermittent renewable generation, a role to which nuclear is less suited. Power demand is expected to be at least one third higher by 2035 as electrification drives decarbonization in other sectors, according to Matt Jones, lead EU power analyst at ICIS. “Though this sends positive commitment across the industry, it will be difficult to achieve unless we find a credible and realistic plan to produce power when the wind does not blow,” Jones said. Kwarteng has promised to set out a strategy this month for how the U.K. will reach net-zero emissions by 2050. He’s also expected to unveil a long-awaited plan on how to decarbonize the country’s heating supply. EDF’s Hinkley Point C is due to be finished in 2026 and the government is figuring out how to finance a second project at Sizewell C. Discussions have been complicated by Johnson’s administration exploring ways to remove state-owned developer China General Nuclear Power Corp. from all future projects in the U.K., Bloomberg reported in July. With a 20-billion-pound ($27.2 billion) price tag, nuclear plants are an expensive option. Legislation is planned as soon as next month for a funding mechanism to spur the construction of new nuclear power plants to replace its aging fleet of reactors. The government said it will support large-scale projects and small and advanced modular reactors too."

""The Facebook Files – and the revelations that the whistleblower has presented to us – underscores just how important it is that we do not let the large tech companies regulate themselves,"" said Danish lawmaker Christel Schaldemose. Schaldemose is the lead rapporteur for the Digital Services Act, announced by the European Commission in December last year that requires tech companies to do more to tackle illegal content. ""The documents finally put all the facts on the table to allow us to adopt a stronger Digital Services Act,"" Alexandra Geese, a German lawmaker at the European parliament, said. ""We need to regulate the whole system and the business model that favours disinformation and violence over factual content – and enables its rapid dissemination,"" she said.

""But we should not be making these decisions on our own ... we've been advocating for updated regulations where democratic governments set industry standards to which we can all adhere."" European Union regulators have been considering whether all online platforms, or only larger ones or those at particular risk of exposure to illegal activities by their users, should be subjected to take-down notices, and how prescriptive these should be.

The device works by detecting patterns of brain activity linked to depression and automatically interrupting them using tiny pulses of electrical stimulation delivered deep inside the brain. The 36-year-old patient, Sarah, said the therapy had returned her to “a life worth living”, allowing her to laugh spontaneously for the first time in five years. Although the therapy has been tested in only one patient – and would only ever be suitable for those with severe illness – the success is seen as hugely significant. It is the first demonstration that the brain activity underlying the symptoms of mental illness can be reliably detected and reveals that these brain circuits can be nudged back into a healthy state, even in a patient who has been unwell for years. “We haven’t been able to do this the kind of personalised therapy previously in psychiatry,” said Katherine Scangos, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who led the work. “This success in itself is an incredible advancement in our knowledge of the brain function that underlies mental illness.” Prof Rupert McShane, a consultant psychiatrist and associate professor at Oxford University, who was not involved in the trial, said: “This is a stunning demonstration … which points to a way of examining the biology of the abrupt slumps into despair that can be so destructive.” Between 10% and 30% of people with depression do not respond to at least two drug treatments – equivalent to about 2.7 million people in the UK. During the past two decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat tens of thousands of patients with Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. However, several trials for depression have ended in disappointment. A major challenge is that the brain does not appear to have a single “depression area”; several interconnected areas can be in play and these can differ between people. “We’re starting to recognise some of the complexity involved in how mood is regulated in the brain as a network,” said Prof Edward Chang of the University of California San Francisco, the neurosurgeon who treated Sarah. A meticulous, personalised approach paved the way for the latest advance. In an initial phase lasting a week, a temporary brain implant recorded a wide range of activity while Sarah regularly logged her mood on a tablet. A machine learning algorithm was used to identify a telltale pattern of activity in the amygdala region accompanying Sarah’s lowest points. Through trial and error the scientists identified a closely connected brain area, the ventral striatum, where a tiny dose of electricity appeared to have an immediate and profound impact. “When I first received stimulation I felt the most intensely joyous sensation and my depression was a distant nightmare for a moment,” said Sarah. “I just laughed out loud. It’s the first time I had spontaneously laughed or smiled … in five years.” In a second round of minimally invasive surgery, a permanent device was implanted, with a tiny battery unit embedded in her skull, to detect the “depression signature” activity in the amygdala and automatically deliver stimulation to the ventral striatum. This happens about 300 times each day, equivalent to about 30 minutes of stimulation. The electrical pulse is not accompanied by any sensation, Sarah said, aside from a subtle feeling of alertness and positivity. “The idea that we can treat symptoms in the moment, as they arise, is a whole new way of addressing the most difficult-to-treat cases of depression,” said Scangos. She hopes the work will also help dissolve the stigma that “comes from the black box nature” of depression. Sarah described a life before the treatment in which she barely moved, no longer had opinions and “only noticed what was ugly in the world”. After five years of suffering, she had run out of treatment options. The profound effect of the implant confirmed to her that her depression was rooted in brain biology and “not a moral failing, but a disorder that could be treated”. The device costs about $35,000 (£26,000) and is an adapted version of one normally used to treat epilepsy, called the NeuroPace RNS System. The UCSF team has already enrolled two more patients and hopes to recruit a further nine to assess whether the technique can be more widely applied. Prof Eileen Joyce, a professor of neuropsychiatry at University College London, who is leading a trial using deep brain stimulation for OCD, said: “The results are genuine and significant. It’s a remarkable piece of translational clinical neuroscience. I’m not sure that anyone else in the world is doing that at the moment but I’m sure they will in future.” McShane said that while the method would not be widely or immediately applied, “if I was a medical student thinking about which field will show exciting developments during my working life, I would be clocking this as a reason to be considering psychiatry”. The findings are published in the journal Nature Medicine."

Thirty five current and former leaders are featured in roughly 11.9 million documents leaked from financial services companies that include reports of luxury mansions on the French Riviera, Monte Carlo and California. The so-called ""Pandora Papers"" were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and released in stories by media partners including The Washington Post, the BBC and The Guardian. Allegations range from corruption to money laundering and tax evasion. Holding assets offshore or using shell companies is not illegal in most countries, but the revelations are embarrassing for leaders who have pushed austerity measures or campaigned against corruption. It is the largest investigation of its kind Gal ROMA AFP While Russian leader Vladimir Putin is not named, he is linked via associates to secret assets in Monaco, including a waterfront home acquired by a Russian woman reported to have had a child with him. ""This is just a set of largely unsubstantiated claims,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We didn't see anything on hidden wealth within Putin's inner circle."" Jordan rejected as ""distorted"" reports that King Abdullah II created a network of offshore companies and tax havens to amass a $100 million property empire stretching from California to London. - 'Nothing to hide' - Abdullah did not directly address the issue but denounced what he called a ""campaign against Jordan"". ""Attempts to embarrass Jordan have been going on for some time, and there are still those who want to sabotage it and sow suspicions,"" a royal court statement quoted him as saying to a group of tribal elders. ""We have nothing to hide"". Prominent leaders featured in the Pandora Papers John SAEKI AFP The country's royal court said the properties were funded with the king's personal wealth and were used for official and private visits. Ivory Coast Prime Minister Patrick Achi also denied wrongdoing after allegations that he became the owner of Bahamas-based company Allstar Consultancy Services Ltd through a trust that obscured his ownership. Achi's office denounced the ""malicious use seemingly being made of this information"" that dates back to the late 1990s when he was an adviser to Ivory Coast's energy minister. Achi ""will not allow his name to be linked with illicit activities and thereby sullied"", the statement added. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said the papers would ""enhance financial transparency"", but sidestepped allegations that his family owned 11 offshore companies worth millions of dollars. ""The movement of illicit funds, proceeds of crime and corruption thrive in an environment of secrecy and darkness,"" said Kenyatta, the son of independent Kenya's first president. - Czech PM hits back - The ICIJ found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials. Among them were more than a dozen serving heads of state and government, country leaders, cabinet ministers, ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands. Family and associates of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev -- long accused of corruption in the central Asian nation -- are alleged to have been secretly involved in property deals in Britain worth hundreds of millions. The documents also show how Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis -- who faces an election later this week -- failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase a chateau worth $22 million in the south of France. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis denounced allegations against him as a smear attempt ahead of elections Aris Oikonomou AFP/File ""I have never done anything illegal or wrong,"" Babis tweeted, calling the revelations a smear attempt aimed at influencing the election. Nearly two million of the 11.9 million leaked documents came from a Panamanian law firm called Alcogal. Alcogal has rejected accusations of shady dealings. ICIJ's director Gerard Ryle said in a video accompanying the investigation that those best placed to halt such practices were the ones benefiting the most. - 'Promotes corruption' - Transparency International's Maira Martini called for an end to the offshore industry, saying the investigation once more offered ""clear evidence"" of how it ""promotes corruption and financial crime"". European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc needed to do ""more work"" to combat tax evasion. Among the other revelations from the ICIJ investigation: The public figures exposed by the 'Pandora Papers' included the Colombian singer Shakira-- whose lawyers said her offshore assets were legitimate TOM PENNINGTON GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/File -- Britain's former prime minister Tony Blair is shown to have legally avoided paying stamp duty on a London property by buying the offshore company that owned it. -- Members of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle are said to secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. Khan vowed to ""take appropriate action"" if any wrongdoing is proved. -- Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso and Gabon's Ali Bongo were linked with companies in the British Virgin Islands in a report by Le Monde, one of the media partners in the investigation. The ""Pandora Papers"" are the latest in a series of mass leaks handled by the ICIJ, from LuxLeaks in 2014, to the 2016 Panama Papers. They were followed by the Paradise Papers in 2017 and FinCen files in 2020. burs-ach/jj © 2021 AFP"

""We took (them) all forcibly overnight,"" he said. ""If there were hundreds of people in one county in this area, then you had to arrest these hundreds of people."" The ex-detective turned whistleblower asked to be identified only as Jiang, to protect his family members who remain in China. In a three-hour interview with CNN, conducted in Europe where he is now in exile, Jiang revealed rare details on what he described as a systematic campaign of torture against ethnic Uyghurs in the region's detention camp system, claims China has denied for years ""Kick them, beat them (until they're) bruised and swollen,"" Jiang said, recalling how he and his colleagues used to interrogate detainees in police detention centers. ""Until they kneel on the floor crying."" During his time in Xinjiang, Jiang said every new detainee was beaten during the interrogation process -- including men, women and children as young as 14. ""Everyone uses different methods. Some even use a wrecking bar, or iron chains with locks.""Jiang, former Chinese detective The methods included shackling people to a metal or wooden ""tiger chair"" -- chairs designed to immobilize suspects -- hanging people from the ceiling, sexual violence, electrocutions, and waterboarding. Inmates were often forced to stay awake for days, and denied food and water, he said. ""Everyone uses different methods. Some even use a wrecking bar, or iron chains with locks,"" Jiang said. ""Police would step on the suspect's face and tell him to confess."" The suspects were accused of terror offenses, said Jiang, but he believes that ""none"" of the hundreds of prisoners he was involved in arresting had committed a crime. ""They are ordinary people,"" he said. Jiang said he was deployed to Xinjiang ""three or four"" times from his normal posting at a police station in China. The short-term deployments came with extra pay. The torture in police detention centers only stopped when the suspects confessed, Jiang said. Then they were usually transferred to another facility, like a prison or an internment camp manned by prison guards. In order to help verify his testimony, Jiang showed CNN his police uniform, official documents, photographs, videos, and identification from his time in China, most of which can't be published to protect his identity. CNN has submitted detailed questions to the Chinese government about his accusations, so far without a response. CNN cannot independently confirm Jiang's claims, but multiple details of his recollections echo the experiences of two Uyghur victims CNN interviewed for this report. More than 50 former inmates of the camp system also provided testimony to Amnesty International for a 160-page report released in June, ""'Like We Were Enemies in a War': China's Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang."" ""The so-called genocide in Xinjiang is nothing but a rumor backed by ulterior motives and an outright lie.""Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman The US State Department estimates that up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have been detained in internment camps in Xinjiang since 2017. China says the camps are vocational, aimed at combating terrorism and separatism, and has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region. ""I want to reiterate that the so-called genocide in Xinjiang is nothing but a rumor backed by ulterior motives and an outright lie,"" said Zhao Lijian, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, during a news conference in June. On Wednesday, officials from the Xinjiang government even introduced a man at a news conference they said was a former detainee, who denied there was torture in the camps, calling such allegations ""utter lies."" It was unclear if he was speaking under duress. 'Everyone needs to hit a target' The first time Jiang was deployed to Xinjiang, he said he was eager to travel there to help defeat a terror threat he was told could threaten his country. After more than 10 years in the police force, he was also keen for a promotion. He said his boss had asked him to take the post, telling him that ""separatist forces want to split the motherland. We must kill them all."" Jiang said he was deployed ""three or four"" times from his usual post in mainland China to work in several areas of Xinjiang during the height of China's ""Strike Hard"" anti-terror campaign. A guard patrols Number 3 Detention Center in Dabancheng in western China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Launched in 2014, the ""Strike Hard"" campaign promoted a mass detention program of the region's ethnic minorities, who could be sent to a prison or an internment camp for simply ""wearing a veil,"" growing ""a long beard,"" or having too many children. Jiang showed CNN one document with an official directive issued by Beijing in 2015, calling on other provinces of China to join the fight against terrorism in the country ""to convey the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions when listening to the report on counter-terrorism work."" Jiang was told that 150,000 police assistants were recruited from provinces around mainland China under a scheme called ""Aid Xinjiang,"" a program that encouraged mainland provinces to provide help to areas of Xinjiang, including public security resources. The temporary postings were financially rewarding -- Jiang said he received double his normal salary and other benefits during his deployment. But quickly, Jiang became disillusioned with his new job -- and the purpose of the crackdown. ""I was surprised when I went for the first time,"" Jiang said. ""There were security checks everywhere. Many restaurants and places are closed. Society was very intense."" During the routine overnight operations, Jiang said they would be given lists of names of people to round up, as part of orders to meet official quotas on the numbers of Uyghurs to detain. ""It's all planned, and it has a system,"" Jiang said. ""Everyone needs to hit a target."" If anyone resisted arrest, the police officers would ""hold the gun against his head and say do not move. If you move, you will be killed."" He said teams of police officers would also search people's houses and download the data from their computers and phones. Another tactic was to use the area's neighborhood committee to call the local population together for a meeting with the village chief, before detaining them en masse. Describing the time as a ""combat period,"" Jiang said officials treated Xinjiang like a war zone, and police officers were told that Uyghurs were enemies of the state. He said it was common knowledge among police officers that 900,000 Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities were detained in the region in a single year. Jiang said if he had resisted the process, he would have been arrested, too. 'Some are just psychopaths' Inside the police detention centers, the main goal was to extract a confession from detainees, with sexual torture being one of the tactics, Jiang said. ""If you want people to confess, you use the electric baton with two sharp tips on top,"" Jiang said. ""We would tie two electrical wires on the tips and set the wires on their genitals while the person is tied up."" ""Some people see this as a job, some are just psychopaths.""Jiang, former Chinese detective He admitted he often had to play ""bad cop"" during interrogations but said he avoided the worst of the violence, unlike some of his colleagues. ""Some people see this as a job, some are just psychopaths,"" he said. One ""very common measure"" of torture and dehumanization was for guards to order prisoners to rape and abuse the new male inmates, Jiang said. Abduweli Ayup, a 48-year-old Uyghur scholar from Xinjiang, said he was detained on August 19, 2013, when police carrying rifles surrounded a kindergarten he had opened to teach young children their native language. On his first night in a police detention center in the city of Kashgar, Ayup says he was gang-raped by more than a dozen Chinese inmates, who had been directed to do this by ""three or four"" prison guards who also witnessed the assault. ""The prison guards, they asked me to take off my underwear"" before telling him to bend over, he said. ""Don't do this, I cried. Please don't do this."" Abduweli Ayup said he was gang-raped by more than a dozen Chinese inmates acting on the orders of guards. He said he passed out during the attack and woke up surrounded by his own vomit and urine. ""I saw the flies, just like flying around me,"" Ayup said. ""I found that the flies are better than me. Because no one can torture them, and no one can rape them."" ""I saw that those guys (were) laughing at me, and (saying) he's so weak,"" he said. ""I heard those words."" He says the humiliation continued the next day, when the prison guards asked him, ""Did you have a good time?"" He said he was transferred from the police detention center to an internment camp, and was eventually released on November 20, 2014, after being forced to confess to a crime of ""illegal fundraising."" His time in detention came before the wider crackdown in the region, but it reflects some of the alleged tactics used to suppress the ethnic minority population which Uyghur people had complained about for years. CNN is awaiting response from the Chinese government about Ayup's testimony. Now living in Norway, Ayup is still teaching and also writing Uyghur language books for children, to try to keep his culture alive. But he says the trauma of his torture will stay with him forever. ""It's the scar in my heart,"" he said. ""I will never forget."" 'They hung us up and beat us' Omir Bekali, who now lives in the Netherlands, is also struggling with the long-term legacy of his experiences within the camp system. ""The agony and the suffering we had (in the camp) will never vanish, will never leave our mind,"" Bekali, 45, told CNN. Omir Bekali holds his official form stating he was released from detention on bail in November 2018, pending trial. Bekali was born in Xinjiang to a Uyghur mother and a Kazakh father, and he moved to Kazakhstan where he got citizenship in 2006. During a business trip to Xinjiang, he said he was detained on March 26, 2017, then a week later he was interrogated and tortured for four days and nights in the basement of a police station in Karamay City. ""They hung us up and beat us on the thigh, on the hips with wooden torches, with iron whips.""Omir Bekali, former Xinjiang detainee ""They put me in a tiger chair,"" Bekali said. ""They hung us up and beat us on the thigh, on the hips with wooden torches, with iron whips."" He said police tried to force him to confess to supporting terrorism, and he spent the following eight months in a series of internment camps. ""When they put the chains on my legs the first time, I understood immediately I am coming to hell,"" Bekali said. He said heavy chains were attached to prisoners' hands and feet, forcing them to stay bent over, even when they were sleeping. He said he lost around half his body weight during his time there, saying he ""looked like a skeleton"" when he emerged. ""I survived from this psychological torture because I am a religious person,"" Bekali said. ""I would never have survived this without my faith. My faith for life, my passion for freedom kept me alive."" During his time in the camps, Bekali said two people that he knew died there. He also says his mother, sister and brother were interned in the camps, and he was told his father Bakri Ibrayim died while detained in Xinjiang on September 18, 2018. Xinjiang government officials responded to CNN's questions about Bekali during the Wednesday news conference, when they confirmed he had been detained for eight months on suspected terror offenses. But officials said his claims of torture and his family's detention were ""total rumors and slander."" His father died of liver cancer, they said, and his family is ""currently leading a normal life."" Omir Bekali was told his father died in detention in Xinjiang on September 18, 2018. Chinese officials said he died from liver cancer. 'I am guilty' From his new home in Europe, former detective Jiang struggles to sleep for more than a couple of hours at a time. The enduring suffering of those who went through the camp system plays on his mind; he feels like he's close to a breakdown. ""I am now numb,"" Jiang said. ""I used to arrest so many people."" Former inmate Ayup also struggles to sleep at night, as he suffers with nightmares of his time in detention, and is unable to escape the constant feeling he is being watched. But he said he still forgives the prison guards who tortured him. ""I don't hate (them),"" Ayup said. ""Because all of them, they're a victim of that system."" ""They sentence themselves there,"" he added. ""They are criminals; they are a part of this criminal system."" Abduweli Ayup looks at one of the children's book written in Uyghur that he uses to keep the language alive. Jiang said even before his time in Xinjiang, he had become ""disappointed"" with the Chinese Communist Party due to increasing levels of corruption. ""They were pretending to serve the people, but they were a bunch of people who wanted to achieve a dictatorship,"" he said. In fleeing China and exposing his experience there, he said he wanted to ""stand on the side of the people."" Now, Jiang knows he can never return to China -- ""they'll beat me half to death,"" he said. ""I'd be arrested. There would be a lot of problems. Defection, treason, leaking government secrets, subversion. (I'd get) them all,"" he said. ""The fact that I speak for Uyghurs (means I) could be charged for participating in a terrorist group. I could be charged for everything imaginable."" When asked what he would do if he came face-to-face with one of his former victims, he said he would be ""scared"" and would ""leave immediately."" ""I am guilty, and I'd hope that a situation like this won't happen to them again,"" Jiang said. ""I'd hope for their forgiveness, but it'd be too difficult for people who suffered from torture like that."" ""How do I face these people?"" he added. ""Even if you're just a soldier, you're still responsible for what happened. You need to execute orders, but so many people did this thing together. We're responsible for this."""

DABS needs about $90 million to address its liabilities, its chief operating officer, Safiullah Ahmadzai, told The Journal. These include debts to power suppliers in neighboring Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. A Taliban cleric replaced Ahmadzai, who was acting as DABS' CEO, on Sunday, the paper reported. As of 2020, DABS paid up to $280 million per year for imported power, according to the Afghan news outlet Tolo News. But the Taliban has so far refused to allow DABS to use the $40 million in its accounts to pay off its creditors, Ahmadzai told The Journal. ""Our neighboring states now have the right to cut our power, under the contract,"" he said. Afghan government receipts have slowed to a trickle as the country's economy founders, making it difficult for families to pay their DABS bills, the paper reported. Afghanistan has long been troubled by fluctuating power supplies, with residents in Kabul complaining in June of high bills and having only limited hours of service per day, Tolo News reported. With the Taliban now in control, electricity supplies have temporarily increased, according to The Journal. The militant group has ceased its attacks on the power grid. A hiatus in industrial and government activity has seen the supply flow toward residential users, the paper reported. But if Afghanistan's suppliers cut the power off, the country could face a crisis come winter, Noorzai told the paper. This is a particular risk with Tajikistan, where the ruler Emomali Rahmon sheltered Afghanistan's ousted President Ashraf Ghani and said he rejects Taliban rule, according to The Diplomat."

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Two members of the European parliament have called for an investigation into allegations by a whistleblower that Facebook (FB.O) prioritised profits above the public good. The whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who had worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, shared internal documents with newspapers and attorneys general from several U.S. states. read more A statement from European Parliament lawmakers said they were requesting further investigations into the revelations. ""The Facebook Files – and the revelations that the whistleblower has presented to us – underscores just how important it is that we do not let the large tech companies regulate themselves,"" said Danish lawmaker Christel Schaldemose. Schaldemose is the lead rapporteur for the Digital Services Act, announced by the European Commission in December last year that requires tech companies to do more to tackle illegal content. ""The documents finally put all the facts on the table to allow us to adopt a stronger Digital Services Act,"" Alexandra Geese, a German lawmaker at the European parliament, said. ""We need to regulate the whole system and the business model that favours disinformation and violence over factual content – and enables its rapid dissemination,"" she said. Both Geese and Schaldemose said they are in touch with Haugen. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""Every day, we make difficult decisions on where to draw lines between free expression and harmful speech, privacy, security, and other issues."" ""But we should not be making these decisions on our own ... we've been advocating for updated regulations where democratic governments set industry standards to which we can all adhere."" European Union regulators have been considering whether all online platforms, or only larger ones or those at particular risk of exposure to illegal activities by their users, should be subjected to take-down notices, and how prescriptive these should be. ""Our position is clear: the power of major platforms over public debate and social life must be subject to democratically validated rules, in particular on transparency and accountability,"" an European Commission spokesperson said when asked about the allegations against Facebook. Tech companies have said it was unfair and not technically feasible for them to police the internet. The current EU e-commerce directive says intermediary service providers play a technical, automatic and passive role. Haugen will testify before an U.S. Senate subcommittee on Tuesday, and is expected to speak at the Web Summit conference in Portugal in early November.

Reform UK held a one-day conference in Manchester alongside the opening of the Conservative Party Conference on Sunday. Reform UK is the successor to the Brexit Party, which Farage led to victory in the May 2019 European elections, and then to defeat in the Parliamentary general election in December 2019. Farage stepped down as party leader in March 2021 to focus on his media career, and has recently taken a significant role at GB News, the right-leaning broadcaster that has suffered from a rocky launch. He wasn't listed on the program for the conference, and was broadcasting for GB News from London on Sunday morning. In an interview with Insider, the party's deputy leader, Dr. David Bull, suggested it was possible Farage might make an appearance. ""Nigel is still around, very much so. He did his bit,"" he said, ""Without telling you too much, he's around."" Asked if that might translate into an appearance on Sunday, Bull said: ""It might do."" But the party's leader, Richard Tice, who inherited the leadership from Farage, was clearer: ""Nigel is focusing on his media career. In a sense, of course, he'd love to be here. ""But equally it's important to try and keep that sort of sense of balance and so he doesn't want it to be seen as a distraction on how he's trying to shape and influence through the media."" Asked if Tice had asked Farage to come to the conference, he said: ""Of course he's very welcome to come. But ultimately, he's a busy guy. He's doing media five days a week. It's not easy."" Farage did not appear at the conference, a party spokesman confirmed. Farage sent a tweet in support of the conference."

The Prime Minister blithely said the food industry 'does involve killing a lot of animals' when asked about the British Meat Processing Association (BMPA) warning that pigs-in-blankets could be scarce because of a lack of trained butchers. It said a gap in the number of abattoir workers means that farmers believe have to 'throw pigs in a skip' because they can't be professionally butchers and sent to market. In a bad-tempered, combative interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme this morning, the PM was asked about the concern about the cull, which if it happened would be the largest in British agricultural history. 'I hate to break it to you Andrew but our food processing industry does involve killing a lot of animals,' he said. Mr Marr responded by sayin: 'Butchering them and then selling them for food, that is not what we are talking about.' But the PM continued: 'That is the reality. Your viewers need to understand that, that is just what happens. The Prime Minister blithely said the food industry 'does involve killing a lot of animals' when asked about the British Meat Processing Association (BMPA) warning that pigs-in-blankets could be scarce because of a lack of trained butchers. In a bad-tempered, combative interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme this morning, the PM was asked about the concern about the cull, which if it happened would be the largest in British agricultural history. 'What you're talking again about is an issue to do with a shortage of another particular type of workforce. 'Actually, what I think needs to happen is again there is a question about the types of jobs that are being done, the pay that is being offered, the levels of automation, the levels of investment.' Told again the pigs will be killed and incinerated rather than sold for food, Mr Johnson accused Mr Marr of 'trying to obfuscate' the point before the presenter explained food processing to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson added: 'The great hecatomb of pigs that you describe has not yet taken place, let's see what happens.' But shadow environment minister Luke Pollard said: 'The Prime Minister needs to take this seriously. 'The government's incompetence and chaotic lack of planning is about to lead to the biggest peacetime cull of pigs. Healthy animals will be destroyed because of a shortage of vets, abbatoirs and HGV drivers. 'This cull is a disaster for pig farmers and risks Britain's food security. Yet again blame sits firmly with ministers who are out of touch with working people and sat with their heads in the sand.' Outlining again the desire to boost wages and conditions, Mr Johnson also said: 'There will be a period of adjustment but that is what I think we need to see.' The Cabinet is now said to be considering easing visa restrictions for up to 1,000 foreign butchers to avert the crisis - but The Times claims that Priti Patel is against it and concerned they are being pushed by British industry to move back towards pre-Brexit freedom of movement The British Meat Processors Association said last week that the 1,000 EU butchers is still 14,000 short of the 15,000 the country needs. This means that businesses are focussing on keeping supermarkets stocked with simple cuts of meat such as bacon, steaks and chops, meaning Christmas favourites such as pigs in blankets and hams could be in short supply. A BMPA spokesperson said: 'We really should have been producing Christmas food from about June or July onwards this year and so far we haven't, so there'll be shortages of party foods and things like pigs in blankets. Anything that is labour-intensive work could see shortages.' Mr Johnson also admitted he has known for months that the UK's haulage industry was in trouble, as he indicated the supply chain problems besetting the economy could continue until Christmas. On the opening day of the Tory Party Conference in Manchester, the Prime Minister insisted the fuel crisis was 'abating' despite continuing reports of long queues for petrol in some parts of the economy. However, he acknowledged the UK economy was facing 'stresses and strains' as it moved away from the 'broken model' which, he said, had been rejected by voters in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But Mr Johnson insisted he would not solve the issues in the labour market - which have led to warnings of shortages on the shelves in the run-up to the festive season - by pulling 'the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration' to allow in large numbers of foreign workers. Asked on Marr about a warning by Chancellor Rishi Sunak that shortages could continue to Christmas, Mr Johnson said: 'Rishi is invariably right in everything he says.' He then added hurriedly: 'It depends how you interpret what he is saying.' Mr Johnson was also pressed on a warning given by the Road Haulage Association which wrote to him in June saying a major crisis was building in their industry due to the shortage of HGV drivers. The Prime Minister said: 'We have known about shortages in road haulage long before then. They have been a chronic feature of the way the road haulage industry has worked.'"

His crime was slandering the country’s ruler, King Abdullah II, simply by asking a single question: how much land does the king own? In a country propped up by billions of dollars in international financial aid – and where unemployment has nearly doubled over the past seven years – the topic is considered too sensitive for the Jordanian public to know about. But today, the Guardian can reveal part of the answer, thanks to documents that form the Pandora papers, the largest ever trove of leaked offshore data. The files expose that the Arab world’s longest-serving current monarch has spent the past decades amassing an international luxury property empire worth well in excess of $100m (£74m), with its footprint stretching from the clifftops of Malibu, California, to Washington DC and on to central London’s most exclusive postcodes. Abdullah built this property empire showing the same zeal for secrecy he has demonstrated when asked about his finances at home. He has disguised his ownership through a series of offshore companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) , according to records shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with the Guardian, the BBC and other media outlets around the world. The multimillion-dollar properties were acquired as US economic and military aid to Jordan quadrupled and Jordanian citizens were subjected to austerity as part of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout for the resource-poor country. Abdullah acquired three clifftop properties on California’s Malibu coast. Photograph: c/o BBC Using offshore companies to acquire property is not illegal and it is sometimes done to protect privacy or security. But the secrecy the offshore system confers on those wealthy enough to keep their purchases from public view can also open the door to money laundering. Perhaps the most palatial – and certainly the most expensive – of the king’s purchases revealed in the Pandora papers is a vast clifftop property on California’s Malibu coast. It is described as a “resort hotel-like mega mansion” containing 26 rooms, overlooking a stretch of coastline made famous as the location of the dramatic final scene in the original 1968 Planet of the Apes film. Quick Guide What are the Pandora papers? Show The Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks. Where did the Pandora documents from come? The ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama. What is an offshore service provider? The 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the “beneficial owner”. Why do people move money offshore? Usually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning. Has everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong? No. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property, even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate, raise moral questions, shed light on how the offshore industry operates, or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.

Public records show the home passed from Hollywood producers to dotcom billionaires, before, the Pandora papers reveal, it was bought by Abdullah in August 2014 for $33.5m, estimated to be a record price for property in the area. The king then acquired the two neighbouring properties. In the previous two years, Abdullah had acquired three condominiums in Washington DC for a total of $13.8m. The leak of papers also reveals how the Jordanian ruler secretly acquired a portfolio of seven luxury UK properties – including three in Belgravia, London. Purchased between 2003 and 2011, the UK properties are estimated to have a current market value of about £28m. The UK was sending up to £100m a year in bilateral aid to Jordan during much of the time covered by the papers. The monarch says he owns his property in a personal capacity – but while there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, the king’s net worth and source of his income remain closely guarded. The king’s lawyers said: “HM [His Majesty] has not at any point misused public monies or made any use whatsoever of the proceeds of aid or assistance intended for public use … HM cares deeply for Jordan and its people and acts with integrity and in the best interests of his country and its citizens at all times.” Jordan appeared to have blocked the ICIJ website on Sunday, hours before the Pandora papers launched. Abdullah has ruled Jordan since the death in 1999 of his father, Hussein, who positioned the kingdom as a key ally of the west and was known for his public displays of wealth. He would speed around the capital, Amman, in one of the dozens of sports cars he owned – most of which are now on display at a museum in the city. His son has maintained the links to the west but is less publicly conspicuous in his spending – in keeping with economic conditions in the country described by US congressional researchers as “extremely difficult”, and which have driven several open challenges to his rule over the past decade. About one in four Jordanians are unemployed, according to 2020 figures, while Jordan has implemented waves of austerity policies over the past three decades in exchange for access to IMF loans, a process Abdullah has accelerated. The moves have led to successive tax hikes and cuts to subsidies on bread, electricity and fuel. The government is also launching a campaign to flush out tax cheats in order to rein in public debt, all of which contrasts starkly with the impact austerity has had on the king. “Under Jordanian laws, HM is not required to pay taxes,” his lawyers said. Protests against cuts to the welfare state and for higher public sector wages have led Abdullah to dismiss several prime ministers over the past decade, in what is seen as a way to relieve public anger and deflect it away from the monarch. His lawyers say Abdullah gives a “significant percentage” of his personal wealth to charitable causes in line with his “vision towards achieving an equitable society”. Abdullah has a portfolio of seven luxury UK properties purchased between 2003 and 2011 – including three in Belgravia, London. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian Nonetheless, the bulk of the Pandora papers property purchases came during a difficult past decade in which Abdullah has faced two public challenges to his rule. The first came as part of the “Arab spring” that swept the Middle East in 2011. Those protests – in which the king and his wife, Queen Rania, were openly accused of “stealing” the country – were crushed by security forces while promises of more democracy have largely failed to materialise. The timing revealed by the Pandora papers raises questions about whether the monarch may have considered the need for a safe haven abroad for himself or his personal fortune. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania. Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex/Shutterstock The second challenge was an alleged coup plot in April of this year cultivated by the king’s half-brother Hamzah, who gained attention and support in some quarters by publicly criticising government corruption and attempts to reform the Jordanian economy by “repeatedly returning to people’s pockets”. Hamzah was placed under house arrest and his alleged accomplices in the sedition plot were sentenced to lengthy jail terms. Eager to shore up a western-friendly ruler, the US has poured increasing financial aid into Jordan over the past decades amounting to a total of $22bn by 2018, and billions more in the years since. Yet at the same time, according to the Pandora papers, the king has spent millions burnishing his property portfolio. The most recent Jordanian budget shows an annual sum of approximately $35m in public funds spent on the upkeep of the country’s royal palaces, but does not list any salary for the king or other working royals. Abdullah’s lawyers said: “The source of HM’s personal wealth is not from public monies, rather from personal sources.” The lengths to which Abdullah has gone to hide details of the purchases also suggest he is aware they will be a politically awkward matter to explain to his subjects. The leaked Pandora documents include a February 2017 internal memorandum between compliance managers at the Panamanian law firm Alcogal, which state that a Jordanian national client called Abdullah Al Hussein, born 30 January 1962 (Abdullah II’s birth date) and with an address of “Raghadan Palace“ (which is located in the royal court compound of al-Maquar in Amman, Jordan), was the beneficial owner of 16 companies that variously held assets in the US, the UK and Jersey. 03:13 What are the Pandora papers? – video explainer Among those companies are Nabisco Holdings SA, Setara Limited and Timara Limited – which acquired the three Malibu clifftop properties – plus a series of other entities that own the king’s property assets in Washington DC and the UK. According to the leaked files, Alcogal staff appear to have worked hard to safeguard the king’s secrecy by not identifying him on internal documents as a politically exposed person (PEP) and discussing ways to avoid storing his identity as beneficial owner. Their reticence reached almost farcical levels, with one December 2017 email between Alcogal employees discussing the “final beneficiary” as a resident of Jordan, then referring to the king simply as “you know who”. Alcogal said it had never “deliberately failed to identify a politically exposed person as such in its due diligence processes”. It said in this case, the beneficial ownership identity details were recorded on the BVI’s beneficial ownership secure search (Boss) system in November 2017 in compliance with the territory’s laws. Moayyad al-Majali, the Jordanian lawyer, was ultimately released but fined.

Narong Phetcharaj was returning to shore when he saw a strange object in the surf at Niyom beach in southern Thailand’s Surat Thani province. He found a large lump of a waxy mass called ambergris, which is French for grey amber. The substance, which is regurgitated by sperm whales, can be sold for up to $40,000 a kilogram. Mr Phetcharaj found a piece weighing about 30kg, which could be worth up to $1.2 million The fisherman took the mass to experts at the Prince of Songkla University, who identified it as ambergris. The substance is produced by sperm whales, which eat large quantities of cephalopods such as squid and cuttlefish and usually vomit out indigestible elements such as the beaks and pens. Sometimes, these parts move into the whale's intestines and bind together, slowly becoming a solid mass which grows inside the huge mammal over many years. The whale then vomits out the mass, which solidifies and floats on the surface of the ocean. It has a foul smell at first but after drying out, it develops a sweet and long-lasting fragrance, making it a sought-after ingredient in the perfume industry. ""None of the villagers has ever seen or touched a real whale ambergris before and that’s why everybody was happy,"" Mr Phetcharaj said. ""I'm so excited; I don’t know what to do. I plan to sell the ambergris as I’ve already received a certificate to prove that it's real. ""If I can get a good price, I'll retire from working as a fisherman and throw a party for my friends.""

The mystery of ambergris The substance has been called the treasure of the sea and referred to as floating gold. Its origin remained a mystery for years, with theories suggested it was hardened sea foam or the droppings of large birds. However, it was not until large-scale whaling began in the 1800s that the discovered was made that the sperm whale was the material’s only producer. Conflicting opinions still exist as to how ambergris emerges from the whale. Many believe that the whale regurgitates the mass – which is where the substance gets its nickname “whale vomit”. Some believe the whale pass the mass along with faecal matter, whereas others say the obstruction grows so large it eventually fatally ruptures the animal."

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s longtime mistress has an estimated net worth of $100 million in “shadow wealth,” including swanky apartments and a yacht, despite her modest background, a trove of newly leaked documents reveal. Svetlana Krivonogikh, 46, has been romantically linked with the Russian strongman since he was still deputy mayor of her hometown of St. Petersburg, and reportedly has a daughter with him. But Krivonogikh — who grew up in a communal apartment — and other Putin cronies have been enriched through shell companies in the Virgin Islands and elsewhere, the Guardian reported. In September 2003, an offshore company called Brockville Development Limited — through two other Panamanian companies — bought her a luxury fourth-floor apartment in Monte Carlo. She’s also acquired a flat in St. Petersburg and other valuable assets, according to the reporting. Krivonogikh is far from alone in benefiting from a long-standing relationship with Putin. For years Russia’s inner circle has gravitated to Monaco, where lax tax laws and policies have made the waterfront city a favorite for the wealthy. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle is accused of hoarding millions of dollars at luxury apartments in Monaco. Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File Putin’s mistress Svetlana Krivonogikh has a net worth of $100 million, according to the Pandora Papers. Proekt Media “It has become Moscow-on-Sea. The mentality is to show off,” local lawyer Dominique Anastasis told the Guardian. “Nobody asks where your money comes from. There’s no culture of checking. You don’t make a tax declaration.” Among the wealthiest of the Russian-Monaco circle is Gennady Timchenko, a former Soviet bureaucrat who has been friends with Putin since the 1990s. A former oil trader, Timchenko was given an oil export license by Putin in 1991, and later co-founded a Swiss-based oil export company named Gunvor — with the Russian president long rumored to be a silent partner in the firm. Forbes reported Timchenko’s net worth at $22 billion, the outlet said. Another member of Putin’s inner circle is Peter Kolbin, an old family friend, who took over as director of Leningrad-based International Petroleum Products in 2003 despite having few qualifications for the job.

The diplomatic discord between Algeria and France deepened Sunday after Algiers banned French military planes from its airspace, its latest response to a row over visas and critical comments from President Emmanuel Macron. Advertising Read more France's jets regularly fly over the former French colony to reach the Sahel region of West Africa, where its soldiers are helping to battle jihadist insurgents as part of its Operation Barkhane. A spokesperson for the French Armed Forces said Algeria had closed its airspace to two flights, but that it would have ""no major consequences"" for operations in the Sahel region. ""This morning when we filed flight plans for two planes, we learned that the Algerians had stopped flights over their territory by French military planes,"" French Armed Forces spokesman, Colonel Pascal Ianni, told AFP. He said the decision had ""slightly impacted"" supply flights but ""does not affect our operations"" in the Sahel. Ianni said there had been no official notification of the flight ban, and the French foreign ministry, contacted by AFP, declined to comment. The move heightened tensions that had already flared Saturday when the Algerian government recalled its ambassador to France, citing ""inadmissible interference"" in its affairs. ‘Official history’ of Algeria ‘totally re-written’ According to French and Algerian media reports, Macron told descendants of figures in Algeria's 1954-62 war for independence that the country was ruled by a ""political-military system"" that had ""totally re-written"" its history. ""You can see that the Algerian system is tired, it has been weakened by the Hirak,"" he added, referring to the pro-democracy movement that forced Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power in 2019 after two decades at the helm. The comments, published in French daily Le Monde, quoted Macron as saying Algeria has an ""official history"" which has been ""totally re-written"". He said this history was ""not based on truths"" but ""on a discourse of hatred towards France"", according to Le Monde. ""Was there an Algeria nation before French colonisation?"" Macron reportedly asked. Algeria won its independence from France in 1962 after a bloody military struggle. Since independence, the North African country's ruling elite has been largely drawn from veterans of its war of liberation from France. Protesters in the Hirak movement have been calling for political change in the gas-rich country, particularly with the clientelist system that has enriched Algeria’s elites. Last year, the Algerian government criminalised the dissemination of what it considers ""false news"" that harms national unity. Saturday's ambassador recall was the second time it had done so, having taken a similar response in May 2020 after French media broadcast a documentary about the Hirak movement. Algerian officials have cracked down on efforts to revive the pro-democracy protests, and rights groups say dozens of people linked to it have been jailed in recent months. Macron's office did not deny the reported comments, but said the president was discussing the war in Algeria with French youths and answering questions, not giving an official interview. Tensions mount over visa issue The latest diplomatic strains came amid tensions over a French decision to sharply reduce the number of visas it grants to citizens of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Paris said the decision had been made necessary by the former colonies' failure to do enough to allow illegal migrants in France to be returned. When a French court denies a person's visa request, authorities must still secure a consular travel pass from his or her home country in order to forcibly expel them, a document that Paris says Algiers, Rabat and Tunis are largely refusing to provide. Macron has reportedly ordered the number of visa deliveries to Algeria and Morocco to be halved from 2020 levels, and by a third for Tunisia. The Algerian foreign ministry summoned France's ambassador François Gouyette on Wednesday to make a ""formal protest"" of the visa ruling.

King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein acquired 14 properties abroad worth more than $106 million (U.S.) using some of his 36 shell companies based in secretive tax havens, a cache of newly leaked documents reveal. He did it at a time when Canada and other Western nations were sending billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance to Jordan. And the man who orchestrated King Abdullah’s obscured offshore asset acquisitions was a former Saskatchewan government accountant. Andrew Evans’s career trajectory ascends from a $26,000 government salary in Regina in the 1980s to the Jordanian royal court where documents show he served as a personal wealth manager to the king. During that tenure, Evans went to extraordinary lengths to hide King Abdullah’s ownership of offshore shell companies and ensure an expanding list of luxury homes could not be traced back to him. In a written statement from his U.K. lawyers, the king acknowledged owning homes around the world for personal use and specified that three apartments are rented out for income. But they vigorously deny any misuse of funds, saying the king’s real estate purchases were made with his personal wealth and that offshore companies were utilized to protect him and his family from potential terrorist attacks. Evans, a British citizen who lives in Switzerland, did not respond to interview requests. When approached at his home by a reporter, he declined to address the allegations directly, saying, “I am retired, I have another life.” The details of the king’s real estate deals and the accountant who facilitated them are contained in the Pandora Papers, a massive leak of offshore corporate records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with the Toronto Star. They include corporate offshore registrations, internal emails, passports and client records that detail the identities of real owners who paid an army of accountants and lawyers to keep their names secret. In emails, Evans asked the local corporate registry agents in the British Virgin Islands to list one of his own firms on the country’s corporate registry in place of the king so nothing could be traced back — a technique that may breach BVI law, according to experts who reviewed the documents on behalf of this investigation. In one email, BVI administrators — Alemán, Cordero, Galindo & Lee, better known as Alcogal — refer to a list of companies provided by Evans with the king’s companies highlighted in yellow. But instead of putting the king’s name in writing, Evans listed them as belonging to “you know who.” Evans also asked Alcogal staff to print out all documents and keep them in hard copy only, shielding them from data leaks, and allow access “only on a need-to-know basis.” King Abdullah, who awards an annual eponymous prize for transparency, purchased the homes between 2003 and 2017. They include a house in Ascot, U.K., where Queen Elizabeth attends horse races; multimillion-dollar apartments in the posh London, U.K., neighbourhoods of Kensington and Belgravia; and three luxury apartments in Washington, D.C., with panoramic views of the Potomac River. They also include side-by-side-by-side beachfront mansions in Malibu, California. One, a seven-bedroom manor on sprawling grounds the size of a football field, was bought in 2014 for $33.5 million (U.S.). Another, next door, will be demolished and rebuilt at twice the size, according to California planning records. The third is currently undergoing renovations to add a swimming pool and a 20 sq. metre outdoor barbecue and fireplace. The Pandora Papers show the king acquired nearly 80 per cent of the properties between 2008 and 2017. In 2012, while the king bought one of his high-end Washington, D.C., properties, thousands of Jordanians filled the streets across the country protesting political and economic turmoil that included chants naming King Abdullah himself: “Oh, Abdullah son of Hussein, where did the people’s money go?” Last year, Jordan’s then-Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz launched a crackdown on tax evasion, which was estimated to be costing the government $800 million (U.S.) a year. The king’s lawyers, in written correspondence, said there is nothing improper in the king’s ownership of properties through offshore companies and that he has not misused public money or aid. Most of the companies identified by reporters either no longer exist or do not relate to him, they said. When asked to detail those properties, they declined due to alleged privacy and security concerns. He has no motivation to avoid taxes by going offshore because, as king, he does not pay taxes, the lawyers said. They said offshore holdings of real estate provided protection from terrorist threats in Jordan and across the Middle East that would put the king and his family at risk if their addresses were made public. Experts in the region point to another possible motivation for the secrecy: potential scandal. “I suspect Jordanians will be outraged,” said Jillian Schwedler, a leading international expert in Middle East politics and author of Faith in Moderation: Islamist Parties in Jordan and Yemen, predicting the public response to the unpopular king’s secret real estate buying spree. “It will be widely condemned and certainly the topic of public debate.” Annelle Sheline, an expert on religious and political authority in the Middle East, told the ICIJ that Jordan isn’t as wealthy as some of the other oil rich states in the region. “Jordan doesn’t have the kind of money that other Middle Eastern monarchies, like Saudi Arabia, have to allow a king to flaunt his wealth,” she said. Sheline, a research fellow with the Quincy Institute in Washington, D.C., added, “If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly, it wouldn’t only antagonize his people, it would piss off Western donors who have given him money.” Since 2011 — when the king began purchasing many of his offshore properties — the crises in neighbouring Syria, Israel and Iraq have taken a heavy economic toll. Jordan, already one the region’s poorest countries, is where many refugees came to flee the nearby turmoil. The kingdom now depends on foreign aid to support its own people and the millions of refugees it hosts. Since the Arab Spring revolutions of 2011, international aid to the Middle East has skyrocketed. The 38 OECD countries, which represent the bulk of international aid, more than doubled their yearly aid to the region, sending a total of nearly $11 billion (U.S.) to Jordan from 2012-2019. In that time, Canada’s assistance grew by almost 20 times, rising from $9 million in 2012 to $157 million in 2017, before dropping to $118 million in 2019, the last year for which statistics are available. In total, Canada sent more than $750 million to Jordan over the last decade. Jordan is now the sixth largest recipient of Canadian aid dollars, getting more money than Iraq, Haiti or Lebanon. Canadian aid goes to fostering girls’ education, funding refugee settlement, anti-terrorism training and economic development assistance. At the same time, King Abdullah’s personal net worth is estimated to be in the range of $750 million to $1 billion (U.S.) That’s almost double Queen Elizabeth II of the U.K’s $520 million estimated net worth but a tiny fraction of King Salman of Saudi Arabia’s approximately $18 billion in personal wealth. “It’s far, far in excess of anything that the royal family ever possessed over the half century preceding King Abdullah’s ascension,” said Sean Yom, a Jordanian expert and associate professor of political science at Temple University. He has not done it alone. “He has always recognized that you need a team of really entrusted people, often from highly educated circles in the West — Western elites, financial elites, banking experts who specialize in private wealth management ... I think his assumption is that the people he pays very, very well to manage his assets for him, to manage his legal matters ... will make things right.” The direct source of his wealth is not entirely clear. But it has inspired nagging and widespread allegations of corruption from many Jordanians and Jordan watchers. “Jordanians have openly declared the royal family as beholden to some sort of corrupt act that has resulted in self-aggrandizement and the market rise of their own wealth portfolios,” Yom said. While Jordan has long been seen as relatively stable ground in an otherwise tumultuous region, that simmering public discontent with the unpopular king has begun spilling over. In April this year, the king was the target of an alleged coup that posed a “threat to the country’s stability,” the government declared. Police arrested 20 people and the king’s younger half-brother, Prince Hamzah bin Hussein, was accused of conspiring against the kingdom. The prince, who has been a long-time thorn in the Jordan government for his public criticisms of corruption in the country, denied involvement. When asked about the political turmoil he is facing during a CNN interview in July, King Abdullah said, “if you’re a member of the royal family, you have privileges. You need to respect those privileges. But also there are restrictions. And the politics at the end of the day is a purview of the monarch.” Throughout the king’s acquisitions, Evans was a fierce defender of his client’s privacy. Little has been known or published about the accountant until now. A Star investigation has pieced together his unique career path. In an online bio, Evans lists himself as an associate of Saskatchewan’s institute of chartered accountants. Saskatchewan government archives show he was hired as an internal auditor in the provincial ministry of finance in 1982 earning a salary of $26,965. According to a former colleague in Saskatchewan, Evans was recruited to the Canadian prairies due to a shortage of accountants at the time and stayed for about a year until leaving for Dubai. “He came in as a trained accountant and had to take Canadian courses at that time,” recalls Arlo Fielden, who worked at the provincial auditor’s office from 1976 to 1983. After leaving Regina, Evans spent more than two decades with the branch office of accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers in the United Arab Emirates as a tax adviser to local clientele before launching his own wealth management firms in Switzerland, Khalij Fiduciaire S.A. and Fidigere S.A, according to Swiss company records. Through his companies, Evans acted as one of the king’s primary wealth managers, according to leaked emails between him and Alcogal, the BVI-based corporate agent that registers companies in Caribbean tax havens. It is unclear how Evans came to represent King Abdullah in his offshore dealings, which would involve the incorporation of at least 36 offshore companies. The documents don’t reveal the exact purpose or assets of all the shell companies owned by the king. Some are described as owning unspecified investments in the U.S. and Europe. In a 2016 draft business agreement between Evans and Alcogal, the king’s wealth manager repeatedly sought to limit when, where and to whom the sovereign’s name would be disclosed. As originally written by Alcogal, the “written terms of business” agreement required the offshore firm to share information about the king’s ownership with BVI authorities, such as tax and law enforcement officials. Evans modified the document to require Alcogal to shield his “unusually sensitive clients.” Alcogal must “store data ... in non-electronic form with access only on a need-to-know basis.” The leaked documents do not say whether Alcogal accepted the modifications; the law firm continued to work with Evans and FidiGere after the agreement was discussed. “Currently we only have one client who fits this category” of such unusually sensitive clients, Evans wrote. While he did not name the king or his companies directly, other documents sent around the same time mention Abdullah by name. Evans was particularly worried about what could happen to the king’s passport. Evans agreed to provide Alcogal with an electronic copy but asked the firm to restrict access and secure it with a password. Alcogal complied. With document handling issues resolved, Alcogal and Evans confronted a thorny question: whether to declare to BVI corporate registry authorities that the companies’ owner was the King of Jordan. Under BVI laws enacted in the wake of bombshell exposes of offshore secrecy, including the 2016 Panama Papers investigation, firms that help create shell companies for clients must provide BVI officials with the names of the actual owners — known as “ultimate beneficial owners” — of all companies registered in the BVI. The information is then recorded on a confidential BVI government registry known as Beneficial Ownership Secure Search, or “BOSS.” Under BVI law, Alcogal must record such information even for companies that move to other tax havens like Panama, as a number of the king’s were. According to the leaked emails, Evans asked Alcogal instead to list on the confidential BOSS register one of his own firms — either Khalij Fiduciaire or Fidigere — and not the king himself as the beneficial owner of the king’s companies. Alcogal’s compliance officer in the BVI found that recording one of Evans’ companies as the beneficial owner of the king’s shell businesses was possible, according to an email from December 2017. But the compliance officer also declared that doing so flouted at least the spirit of the new law, which sought to clean up the island’s reputation as a haven for dirty money. The law required Alcogal to provide ownership information “without delay,” the compliance officer wrote. Listing Khalij or Fidigere “does not facilitate the ‘without delay’ part” of the law, he said. The leaked documents do not show who was ultimately listed as the beneficial owner. In a written response to questions, Alcogal said that the law does not require the firm to disclose details of ownership by politically exposed people, known as PEPs, on the basis of their political ties alone. The firm said that it conducts enhanced background checks on all politically connected individuals. Due diligence laws have changed over time in countries where Alcogal operates, it said. Hakim Creque, a BVI lawyer who works for a firm led by Canadian lawyer and international fraud specialist Martin Kenney, reviewed the BOSS legislation on behalf of this investigation. In a written opinion, he said a sovereign acting in a personal capacity “should be reported as the beneficial owner” and that a company agent who intentionally provides false information about beneficial ownership to the BOSS database would be guilty of a criminal offence punishable by a fine up to $75,000 and imprisonment up to five years.

Almost a quarter of the ministers who attend cabinet have accepted donations from just three well-connected ex-Russians. It comes as the Prime Minister shows off his new cabinet at Tory Party Conference in Manchester, where a huge delivery of alcohol was seen being delivered for party faithful to enjoy. Ministers whose offices or constituencies benefited include Deputy PM Dominic Raab, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and five other MPs who attend Cabinet. Tycoons and benefactors are hurling money at the Conservatives at an astonishing rate as ordinary Brits face painful Universal Credit cuts, National Insurance hikes and soaring energy bills. In the first six months of 2020 donations hit £57,700 a day – £2,400 an hour. Donations total £74m since Mr Johnson took office in 2019. That compares to £38m in the previous two years, under Theresa May, Electoral Commission figures show. The Russian-linked money is revealed after a report last year uncovered allegations that Moscow sought to influence voters in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

For years, oligarchs were able to “buy” citizenship in exchange for a £2million investment in UK bonds or shares through a bank. The report said cash was invested in “PR firms, charities, political interests, academia and cultural institutions” – all of whom were “willing beneficiaries of Russian money”. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “The Government is failing in its first duty to keep our country safe. It’s a year since the Russia Report and not a single recommendation has been implemented. “Ministers are asleep at the wheel, failing to act on crucial matters of national security – from cyber warfare to interference in democratic processes and the laundromat of dirty money. “This inexcusable lack of action is leaving our whole country at risk.” Image: PA) PA) Alexander Temerko and his firm Aquind Energy made a string of donations. Some £10,000 went to Treasury Secretary Simon Clarke’s Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. Aquind is seeking permission to build a huge energy interconnector under the English Channel and in 2012 it got a £4.5m government grant. In 2015 Mr Sunak also saw a £6,000 donation to his Richmond, Yorks, constituency from Mr Temerko, a former aide to ex-Russian President Boris Yeltsin. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan removed herself from decisions on the Aquind plan because of £17,000 in donations from Mr Temerko during her days as a business minister. COP26 president Alok Sharma accepted £10,000 in donations to his constituency association from Aquind in 2019, plus £15,000 from Mr Temerko’s old venture Offshore Group Newcastle (OGN), in 2014. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis received a donation of £10,000 from banker Ms Lubov Chernukhin, the Tories’ biggest individual donor. Dominic Raab declared a £25,000 donation to his Esher and Walton constituency from Dmitry Leus – whose £500,000 gift to royal charities triggered a row over claims foreigners could “buy” residency. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr Temerko, Ms Chernukhin or Mr Leus – all British citizens. A spokesperson for Mr Leus told the Mirror: “He has played no active part in politics. He has devoted time and resources to philanthropic causes, in 2018 setting up the Leus Family Foundation, a registered UK charity, to support children and young people.” A spokesperson for Mr Temerko said: “Mr Temerko is a Ukrainian-born British citizen and has no links to Russia.” Lawyers for Ms Chernukhin have said: “Donations have never been tainted by Kremlin or other influence.”"

A naval officer, who declined to be identified, told VRT news the incident was, “Unheard of, a failure for our navy.” Just last week the defence ministry was boasting that the ship would be taking part in the joint naval exercise ‘Joint Warrior’ with the youngest crew ever deployed. The crew consists of 65% of members under the age of 35 years. “Ships, submarines, aircraft, helicopters and ground troops will participate in Joint Warrior” the ministry said in a statement. “As a result, the ships involved not only learn to work together, but also train together in the highest spectrum of warfare.” But before the exercise could begin, it became clear the young crew had not had sufficient training to allow them to take part. “We are partly the victim of the new young guard that had to be prepared very quickly,” said Oliver Vogels, spokesperson for the navy. “’In addition, everyone who is deployed on a ship must be able to perform two to three functions. So that requires two to three times more training from the young sailors.” Now the ship is docked, and there are some red faces. “This kind of exercises is unique for a crew. It is unprecedented that the Leopold I was not able to join,” one officer told De Tijd. Older sailors are retiring from the service at a dangerously high rate, and they are not being sufficiently replaced by new recruits. ‘We have to recruit new recruits like crazy and train them properly according to defence minister Ludivine Dedonder, but you need trainers and, above all, time for that. And those things are often missing.” “The crew has received extra training and drills over the past three weeks,” said Vogels. “We have brought in extra trainers with a lot of experience.” The service now hopes the Leopold I can sail next week and possibly join the other ships in the exercise."

Luis Lens and César Gimeno were diving off the island of Portitxol in Xàbia on August 24 when they found eight coins, before further dives by archaeologists returned another 45 coins, according to a press release from the University of Alicante on Tuesday. Scientists from the university's Institute in Archaeology and Historical Heritage then analyzed the perfectly preserved coins, dating them to between the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th century. The coins were in such good condition that the inscriptions were legible, allowing the team to identify coins from the reign of a number of Roman emperors. Three date from Valentinian I, seven from Valentinian II, 15 from Theodosius I, 17 from Arcadius, 10 from Honorius and there is one unidentified coin. Archaeologists will carry out further excavations at the site in the next few weeks. University of Alicante Alongside the coins divers found three nails, likely made from copper, as well as lead remains which could be from a severely deteriorated sea chest. Jaime Molina Vidal, professor of ancient history at the University of Alicante and leader of the team of underwater archaeologists, said this was one of the largest sets of Roman gold coins found in Europe. ""It's very significant,"" Molina Vidal told CNN on Thursday. ""It's enormously valuable."" Related content Enormous haul of ancient Roman coins unearthed in Spain The coins were likely hidden by a wealthy local landowner who wanted to protect some of their money from barbarians, who were invading and looting the western Roman Empire at the time, he added. ""We are in the presence of a fantastic archaeological document from the time when, in this case, the Alans arrived,"" said Molina Vidal. The Alans, Suevi and Vandals invaded the area in the final phase of the fall of the Western Empire, and the political power of the Romans in the Iberian peninsula ended in 409 AD, the press release adds. Whoever hid the coins likely died before they were able to collect them, said Molina Vidal, leaving them undiscovered for about 1,500 years. Despite their age they are remarkably well preserved. Related content More than 650 silver Roman coins found in a jug in Turkey ""It's like they were made yesterday,"" said Molina Vidal, who explained that only one coin is unidentifiable as its inscription has been scratched. The coins will be restored and then exhibited at the Soler Blasco Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum in Xàbia. Further archaeological exploration in the area will be funded by the Valencia local government, which has allocated 17,800 euros ($21,000) to the team. The bay of Portitxol is a well-known archaeological site where anchors, amphorae, ceramic remains and other artifacts have been discovered."

Carter said he believes that co-operation could be expanded to the benefit of both countries. The British Army has for many years conducted armoured and combined warfare training at Suffield, Alta. Keeping a closer eye on the Arctic The Arctic is becoming more of a focus for NATO and Canada's closest allies. The potential threat posed by the reactivation of Russia's northern Cold War-era bases, as well as the interest of possible adversaries such as China, figured prominently in speeches and panel discussions at the recent NATO leaders summit last June. Canada's former Conservative government placed a premium on increasing Canada's military presence in the Far North; it built a naval refuelling station and set in motion the construction of Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships, which are just being delivered. Then-prime minister Stephen Harper looks down the shoreline in the Arctic port of Nanisivik, Nunavut on August 10, 2007. (Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press) Those measures offer Canada's military limited capabilities, however. Underwater and satellite surveillance of the region is still in the planning and early implementation phases. Carter said the U.K. has capabilities that could help keep closer tabs on the Arctic's rapidly melting seas and inlets, but it would be up to the Canadian government to decide. ""We would absolutely defer to Canada's expertise in this,"" Carter told CBC News. ""I think we have military capabilities, certainly in the maritime domain and in terms of our science that would be useful to Canada and I think operating alongside Canada in that regard is going to be clearly good for both countries."" Going nuclear What Britain has — and Canada lacks — is a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, which can operate under ice for extended periods of time. When Canada bought its current diesel-electric submarines from Britain in the late 1990s it embarked on a project to retrofit them with fuel cells that would have delivered better, longer under-ice performance. The plan fell through and was quietly shelved. In the late 1980s, the Conservative government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney proposed buying 12 nuclear-powered submarines with the goal of using them for Arctic defence. The end of the Cold War and subsequent defence cuts caused the plan to be shelved. The University of Calgary's Rob Huebert, one of the country's leading experts on Arctic defence, said that after a hiatus of almost a dozen years, the British rejoined the biennial American high Arctic military exercise in 2018 with their nuclear-powered submarines. Back in March, the Russians deployed three ultra-quiet nuclear subs to simultaneously punch through the Arctic ice in the same location — a demonstration that set the defence community buzzing. Three nuclear submarines owned by Russia manoeuvred to break through several feet of Arctic ice at the same time in March 2021. (Russian Defence Ministry) ""We do not have the capability of engaging Russian submarines or Chinese submarines, if and when that ever becomes a reality,"" said Huebert, speaking about the Canadian navy's Arctic inventory. ""That's the No. 1 capability that the British bring to the Arctic."" In a statement to CBC News, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan's office said the Arctic is a zone of global co-operation that ""demands continued collaboration and partnership with our close allies, including the United Kingdom."" Spokesperson Daniel Minden, without closing the door on the idea, said Canada will continue to seek opportunities to work with allies and partners, including the United States and NATO allies, to foster information-sharing and improve situational awareness in the region. ""The United Kingdom is a close partner with whom the Canadian Armed Forces have excellent interoperability, and we look forward to increased military collaboration in the future,"" Minden said in an email. Huebert said successive Canadian governments have been reluctant to let the allies become more deeply involved in the region, beyond the Operation Nanook exercise held each summer. ""We're fearful any type of involvement with NATO would undermine our sovereignty,"" said Huebert, noting that both the United States and Britain do not recognize Canada's claim to the Northwest Passage. Canada needs to show the flag: defence expert The British offer of co-operation and assistance is a wake-up call for the Liberal government on several different fronts, said Dave Perry, a vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. It is, he said, a reminder that Canada needs to be more present in the region. ""There have been [Canadian] commitments to increase the situational awareness there, but that has a long way to go, and the thing for Canadians to remember is that it is our actual territory and our backyard,"" he said. ""I think it is great to work with other people, but we should be doing what we can to make sure we have a home field advantage."" With Australia planning to acquire nuclear submarines — which conceivably could operate in the Arctic as well — Perry was asked if Canada will have to rely more on its allies to monitor and defend its territory. ""I think the AUKUS deal is an indicator that there are some countries with whom we have been intimately familiar and intimately allied with. Some of our best friends on the planet are firming even tighter, smaller clubs,"" he said. ""The United States under successive administrations is being far less benign about allies that they look at as pulling — or not pulling — their weight ... The United States is looking for people who will pull their weight."""

Instead, the senior priest — who heads Germany's largest archdiocese — will take a sabbatical at his own request. Pope grants 'spiritual time-out' The decision came after talks between Pope Francis and Woelki on a child sexual abuse crisis that has rocked the church in Germany. The Vatican said it was clear that Woelki needed ""time to reflect, to renew and to reconcile."" ""This has led Pope Francis to accommodate Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki's wish for a spiritual time-out,"" the Holy See said in a statement. An administrator is to be appointed while Woelki is away, from mid-October to the beginning of March. A carnival float depicting a sleeping cardinal, in response to allegations of the cover-up earlier this year Papal investigation launched In May, the pope sent two envoys to look at possible mistakes committed by Woelki, who was criticized for his handling of the historic sexual abuse allegations. There was particular criticism for his decision not to publish a report into wrongdoing. Woelki said he disagreed with the way it was carried out and cited legal concerns about the document, subsequently commissioning a separate external report. He was accused of trying to protect the priests involved. The second document, released in March this year, showed 314 people — mainly boys under the age of 14 — were abused by clergy in the Cologne diocese between 1975 and 2018. Woelki himself was cleared of wrongdoing by the report and has repeatedly rejected calls for his resignation.

High-ranking members of the organization were accused of failing to follow up on or report cases of abuse, not sanctioning perpetrators, or not caring for victims. Earlier this month, Pope Francis rejected the resignation of Hamburg's archbishop Stefan Hesse. Hesse had offered to step down in March after he was accused of mishandling sexual abuse allegations in the second report commissioned by Woelki. Hesse in particular was faulted for 11 cases of neglecting his duty. He conceded that he had made ""mistakes'' in the past, but denied actively aiding efforts to shield abusers. Following the report's findings, Francis granted Hesse a ""time out'' of unspecified length. rc/rt (dpa, Reuters, AP)"

Images of the latest haul were snapped by a Faroese local on Wednesday evening (local time) and shared to conservation group Sea Shepherd. Blood can be seen trickling from the bodies of pilot whales which are lined up in neat rows along a drain, after they were killed in waters off the tiny Faroe Islands village of Kollafjordur. An estimated 52 pilot whales were killed by Faroese hunters on Wednesday. Source: Sea Shepherd Speaking with Yahoo News Australia from Denmark this morning, Sea Shepherd’s Valentina Crast said the situation had left her and many of the islanders feeling “shocked and angry”. “We have a few local volunteers who are anonymous, but are very committed to documenting what they can and sharing it with us so we can get it out to the world,” she said. “These new images were done by a local who really wants us to end these killings.” Key facts about dolphin slaughter on the Faroe Islands Dolphin and whale slaughter knowns as ""grindadrap"" translates as “murder of whales” Sea Shepherd has been campaigning against the hunt since the 1980s The grindadrap likely dates back 1200 years Modern aids like motorboats are used today to help islanders herd whales and dolphins Whales could be seen lined up ready to be butchered for their meat. Source: Sea Shepherd What you need to know about the slaughter of almost 1500 dolphins Surprise at whale slaughter despite worldwide outrage at 'tradition' Reports suggest 52 whales were butchered overnight, leaving observers “surprised” that it would occur so soon after their last major hunt attracted worldwide attention. The “dolphin massacre”, as it was dubbed, led to unprecedented outrage among locals across the Faroe Islands, a self-governing Danish territory, with a survey suggesting over 50 per cent of respondents want dolphin killing to end. Story continues Known locally as the grindadrap (murder of whales), the annual hunt dates back 1200 years, and is a fiercely protected tradition on the island, however even the territory’s hunt chairman Heri Petersen condemned this month’s record-breaking dolphin slaughter. He told local media he did not know the incident was taking place, and that it would damage the regions’ reputation. The survey indicated support for pilot whale killing remains strong, with 80 per cent of Faroese saying the annual migrational hunts should continue. Video showed knives used to slaughter dolphins as locals, including children, watched on. Source: Sea Shepherd Health authorities recommend locals eat no more than 200 grams of whale or dolphin flesh a month, due to high levels of contaminants in the flesh, meaning the dolphins killed earlier this month were more than enough to feed the islands’ 50,000 residents. Sea Shepherd calculate that less than 300 whales could feed the entire archipelago, but this year 667 pilot whales and 1428 dolphins have been killed. Unlike the Japanese dolphin hunters in Taiji who must comply with a quota, there are no restrictions imposed by either Denmark or the European Union on the number of cetaceans the Faroese can kill. “The Faroese have no quota for the grindadrap hunts, no season, no need for the meat and it seems no compassion,” Sea Shepherd’s Rob Read told Yahoo News Australia. Over the last decade, figures indicate the Faroese have killed 6,276 long-finned pilot whales, 24 northern bottlenose whales and 2,654 Atlantic white sided dolphins. Do you have a story tip?

These findings are raising concerns about the long-term impacts that the coronavirus might have on biological processes such as aging. As a cognitive neuroscientist, my past research has focused on understanding how normal brain changes related to aging affect people’s ability to think and move – particularly in middle age and beyond. But as more evidence came in showing that COVID-19 could affect the body and brain for months or longer following infection, my research team became interested in exploring how it might also impact the natural process of aging. Peering in at the brain’s response to COVID-19 In August 2021, a preliminary but large-scale study investigating brain changes in people who had experienced COVID-19 drew a great deal of attention within the neuroscience community. In that study, researchers relied on an existing database called the UK Biobank, which contains brain imaging data from over 45,000 people in the U.K. going back to 2014. This means – crucially – that there was baseline data and brain imaging of all of those people from before the pandemic. The research team analyzed the brain imaging data and then brought back those who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 for additional brain scans. They compared people who had experienced COVID-19 to participants who had not, carefully matching the groups based on age, sex, baseline test date and study location, as well as common risk factors for disease, such as health variables and socioeconomic status. The team found marked differences in gray matter – which is made up of the cell bodies of neurons that process information in the brain – between those who had been infected with COVID-19 and those who had not. Specifically, the thickness of the gray matter tissue in brain regions known as the frontal and temporal lobes was reduced in the COVID-19 group, differing from the typical patterns seen in the group that hadn’t experienced COVID-19. Story continues In the general population, it is normal to see some change in gray matter volume or thickness over time as people age, but the changes were larger than normal in those who had been infected with COVID-19. Interestingly, when the researchers separated the individuals who had severe enough illness to require hospitalization, the results were the same as for those who had experienced milder COVID-19. That is, people who had been infected with COVID-19 showed a loss of brain volume even when the disease was not severe enough to require hospitalization. Finally, researchers also investigated changes in performance on cognitive tasks and found that those who had contracted COVID-19 were slower in processing information, relative to those who had not. While we have to be careful interpreting these findings as they await formal peer review, the large sample, pre- and post-illness data in the same people and careful matching with people who had not had COVID-19 have made this preliminary work particularly valuable. What do these changes in brain volume mean? Early on in the pandemic, one of the most common reports from those infected with COVID-19 was the loss of sense of taste and smell. Strikingly, the brain regions that the U.K. researchers found to be impacted by COVID-19 are all linked to the olfactory bulb, a structure near the front of the brain that passes signals about smells from the nose to other brain regions. The olfactory bulb has connections to regions of the temporal lobe. We often talk about the temporal lobe in the context of aging and Alzheimer’s disease because it is where the hippocampus is located. The hippocampus is likely to play a key role in aging, given its involvement in memory and cognitive processes. The sense of smell is also important to Alzheimer’s research, as some data has suggested that those at risk for the disease have a reduced sense of smell. While it is far too early to draw any conclusions about the long-term impacts of these COVID-related changes, investigating possible connections between COVID-19-related brain changes and memory is of great interest – particularly given the regions implicated and their importance in memory and Alzheimer’s disease. Looking ahead These new findings bring about important yet unanswered questions: What do these brain changes following COVID-19 mean for the process and pace of aging? And, over time does the brain recover to some extent from viral infection? These are active and open areas of research, some of which we are beginning to do in my own laboratory in conjunction with our ongoing work investigating brain aging. Brain scans from a person in their 30s and a person in their 80s, showing reduced brain volume in the older adult brain Our lab’s work demonstrates that as people age, the brain thinks and processes information differently. In addition, we’ve observed changes over time in how peoples’ bodies move and how people learn new motor skills. Several decades of work have demonstrated that older adults have a harder time processing and manipulating information – such as updating a mental grocery list – but they typically maintain their knowledge of facts and vocabulary. With respect to motor skills, we know that older adults still learn, but they do so more slowly then young adults. When it comes to brain structure, we typically see a decrease in the size of the brain in adults over age 65. This decrease is not just localized to one area. Differences can be seen across many regions of the brain. There is also typically an increase in cerebrospinal fluid that fills space due to the loss of brain tissue. In addition, white matter, the insulation on axons – long cables that carry electrical impulses between nerve cells – is also less intact in older adults. As life expectancy has increased in the past decades, more individuals are reaching older age. While the goal is for all to live long and healthy lives, even in the best-case scenario where one ages without disease or disability, older adulthood brings on changes in how we think and move. Learning how all of these puzzle pieces fit together will help us unravel the mysteries of aging so that we can help improve quality of life and function for aging individuals. And now, in the context of COVID-19, it will help us understand the degree to which the brain may recover after illness as well. [Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend.

Law 105, tabled Thursday morning and adopted that same evening, also makes it illegal to organize or ""incite"" someone to organize protests at those places. People who protest or help organize them will be subject to fines of $1,000 to $6,000. Those fines double for anyone who ""threatens or intimidates a person who is going to, trying to access or leaving"" these types of facilities. The law also allows a Superior Court judge to grant an injunction to either prevent a protest from taking place or stop someone from organizing one. The new law does not stop health-care workers or school staff from protesting conditions at their workplaces. The Coalition Avenir Québec said the law is a response to recent anti-vaccine demonstrations outside schools and hospitals. It was tabled in a bill at the National Assembly by Geneviève Guilbault, the province's public security minister. On Wednesday, Premier François Legault said the legislation was necessary, adding that his patience with protesters ""had reached its limit."" He also urged opposition parties to support it so that it could be adopted quickly. ""We're taking action to protect our children, protect our nurses [and] protect our patients,"" the premier said on Thursday morning. ""What's important is that we adopt this today."" New law applies for 30-day period, but it can be renewed All parties agreed to fast-track the proposed bill. MNAs had few hours to study it and propose amendments. ""We're not against people demonstrating,"" said Dominique Anglade, the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party. ""We're against people intimidating and demonstrating in front of children and in locations that are dangerous for the people that are impacted."" Manon Massé, co-spokesperson for Québec Solidaire, said the proposed bill must respect people's right to protest. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press) Manon Massé, co-spokesperson of Québec Solidaire, said it's important to protect children and health-care workers while respecting people's right to protest. ""It's important for the law to bring measures that are exceptional, temporary and specific,"" Massé said. The law will apply for a 30-day period — an amendment that was suggested by Claire Samson, the lone MNA at the National Assembly for the Conservative Party of Quebec. There is a provision, however, that allows the government to renew the law's 30-day application period. The law will no longer apply once the province's public health emergency is declared over. The public health emergency has been in place since March 13, 2020. Law 105 goes further than existing provincial laws that prevent people from blocking access to schools, hospitals and clinics. Quebec also banned protests within 50 metres of abortion clinics in 2016. Human rights lawyer says bill violates charter Before it was adopted, Montreal human rights lawyer Julius Grey said the proposed law is a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Beyond that, it is unnecessary because there is already a prohibition on unlawful assembly, he said. That means demonstrations could be stopped when they become violent, too loud, or contrary to municipal by-laws. Already, unions regularly hold demonstrations in front of hospitals and schools, he said. ""The right to demonstrate is a fundamental right. You can, of course, regulate it,"" Grey said. Banning demonstrations within 10 metres of a door or from going after individual students would be more reasonable, but limiting protests to 50 metres away from schools, for example, appears to be an effort to stop the anti-vaccination message from reaching students, Grey said. ""I don't think it's the role of the government to block the message,"" said Grey."

Despite the hostile terrain, the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, where Malana is located, earlier this month became the first in India to administer at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose in all its adults. The steep topography was one challenge overcome by health workers walking for hours or days to reach remote villages and another was religious beliefs, as the tourism-dependent state immunised its roughly 5 million adults. On Sept. 14, a team of five led by district health officer Dr Atul Gupta set out to Malana to administer second vaccine doses. Blocked by the landslide, they left their vehicle with two blue vaccine boxes slung over their shoulders to manoeuvre over the rubble, climb the wall and then walk to the trailhead leading to the village, accompanied by a Reuters photographer. Before beginning the trek to the village, Gupta and his team placed the boxes onto a gondola connected to pulleys to carry the medicine across the river gorge that separates Malana from the road. That lightened their walk considerably as they set off to cross the gorge which drops down about 100 metres (330 feet). During a rest break on the trek, Gupta said that to convince Malana's 1,100 adults to take their first shots in August, its district chief had priests invoke a local Hindu deity. This helped health workers cover up to 700 people in three days, he said. When Gupta's team reached the village on Sept. 14, nearly three dozen people, who took their first shots before the invocation, lined up to get their second shots just opposite an ancient temple to the deity. ""People were initially scared to take the vaccine, worried they would fall sick or die,"" said village head Rajuram, who gave just one name, sitting by the carved wood and concrete walls of the temple. ""Then I took it and others also mustered the courage."" Himachal Pradesh's Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur pins the state's vaccination success to its village-to-village drive, its decision to involve local-level politicians, and the federal government's push to prioritise immunisations in tourist hotspots. India wants to vaccinate nearly all of its adults by December, having administered at least one dose to two-thirds of people and two doses in less than a quarter. Thakur wants Himachal Pradesh to be the fastest state to reach the two-dose milestone, hopefully by November."

NZ Herald's Claire Trevett sits down to discuss what a 90 per cent-plus vaccination rate could look like for New Zealand. Video / Mark Mitchell Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says a no jab - no entry policy in crowded places is likely to be part of a suite of measures to control Covid-19 and as an incentive to get vaccination rates up. Speaking to the Weekend Herald about the hopes of getting at least 90 per cent of the country vaccinated, Ardern said 90 per cent plus was a promise of a life that was ""more normal."" She described it as a ""golden ticket"" which would mean no, or restricted lockdowns. Instead, Ardern said measures that did not have big impacts on daily life could be used. The details of the restrictions that would apply at high vaccination rates would be released in the next few weeks. She confirmed it was likely to include vaccination passes - restricting entry to some venues to vaccinated people only or possibly those who could prove a negative test. Such a tool could be useful if vaccination uptake stalled short of 90 per cent mark, as it would act as an incentive for people to get vaccinated. Jacinda Ardern is confident NZ can once again be Covid-free. Photo / Mark Mitchell ""But they might not necessarily be something that you have to use forever. Denmark used them for a period, a few months, and now it is optional."" It is a change of heart by the Prime Minister, who has previously said she was not comfortable with such a measure. In an interview with the NZ Herald in early August, Ardern said she was not keen on measures being used in countries such as France and Denmark where only vaccinated people were allowed into crowded venues such as restaurants, sports stadiums, concerts and night clubs. ""People would not consider it freedom of movement if you're only able to go and partake in activities if you're vaccinated. That's a very different style of approach,"" Ardern said then. Asked what had changed since then, Ardern said she had seen how they worked alongside other measures in other countries. ""Having panned around now, I can see how they can fit into a toolbox. The other thing we're seeing is some countries have used them initially for a period of time. It has helped increase vaccination rates and then they have not had to continue using them."" ""So I do think options like that we should consider whether or not it is an extra way we can still get to go out and enjoy events and things in a way that doesn't come at a great cost to everyone."" Ardern said it could be part of a wider framework that could apply to help avoid lockdowns. ""You might have some day to day measures, so you give a little bit every day so as not to have lockdowns every once in a while. It doesn't have to be a huge departure from freedom."" Ardern spoke to the Weekend Herald soon after modelling by Te Pūnaha Matatini was released, indicating vaccination rates above 90 per cent of the population were needed to be sure of avoiding lockdowns and border restrictions. The Herald last Saturday launched a campaign to get 90 per cent of eligible New Zealanders vaccinated by Christmas. Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield has also said 90 per cent is ""mission critical."" Ardern said ""90 plus"" was her own hope. ""We're not just saying 90 for the sake of it. 90 is what makes life feel more normal. And I think that's what people are looking for. They're saying what is going to make the difference to us in getting back to a way of life that doesn't have the anxiety that everyone has had for a year and a half."" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern with daughter Neve Ardern Gayford.

As I've said before with the decisions that were made for the 12-plus [group], we sat around as both politicians and parents."" Pfizer says it has confirmed a safe and effective paediatric dose of its vaccine for children aged 5 – 12. Ardern said the dose for young children would go through the MedSafe process in New Zealand and the Covid health advisory group would consider it before Cabinet decided whether to push the green light on it. She said New Zealand had ordered more than enough Pfizer vaccines to cover the younger children if needed. The children's version was a smaller dose of the same vaccine being used for adults. AUCKLAND: While vaccinations might help prevent future lockdowns, it is unlikely to have much impact on shortening the restrictions needed to deal with this outbreak. The push to get Auckland vaccinated over the lockdown period lifted the numbers with at least one dose up to 80 per cent in Auckland. However, only about 43 per cent were fully vaccinated so far. Ardern said that meant the aim for this outbreak was still elimination and lockdown levels were still needed. ""What matters is people getting double vaccinated. We need people to have the full vaccination to get the full benefits that vaccinations bring. We need to see that in Auckland and elsewhere. ""So when we moved to three, it was not because we've seen good vaccination rates."" Ardern said about 95 per cent of people had been getting that second dose so she was confident. PM Jacinda Ardern gets her second Covid-19 vaccination from nurse Gordana Nezich in July. Photo / Michael Craig The rates of those fully vaccinated are expected to catch up over the next six weeks as those people who got their first jabs during the six weeks of lockdowns return to get their second doses. Auckland is at level 3 until at least October 4, when it will be reviewed. The decision around whether the outbreak in Auckland was contained enough to move to level 2 would be made regardless of the vaccination rates at the time. Where to get a vaccination in Auckland - without a booking ""Auckland would not have to be at zero cases [to drop to level 2] but it would have to be well contained."" She said decisions had not yet been made on what that would mean for travel to other regions from Auckland if Auckland was at Delta 2, and the rest of New Zealand at a lower level. Ardern remained confident New Zealand could once again return to being Covid-free - and did not believe Auckland would need to be put back into level 4 to get there. She said she was not nervous about the extra activity at level 3 – or the younger, less vaccinated population going back to work. She said previous outbreaks had only required level 3 – and while this was Delta, it should be possible to stamp out the tail end of the outbreak at level 3. The first days of level 3 had delivered case numbers of less than 20, but mostly household or close contacts. The Tattoo Challenge: Ardern has issued a challenge to Auckland to get to a 90 per cent vaccination rate as soon as possible – and the NZ Herald had its own 90 per cent challenge for Ardern. In the past Ardern has said she had wanted a tattoo of explorer Ernest Shackleton. Asked if she would get that tattoo if we got to 90 per cent, Ardern laughed and said she would think about it. ""Do you know what, if I thought putting myself on the line in that way would get New Zealand to 90 per cent, there are actually quite a few things I would agree to do. That's how much it means to me. ""Everyone has given up so much already for that same goal. We're now just asking people to do something a little extra to help with that. But not quite a tattoo. Let me come back to you."""

In recent months and years, several stand-up comics and other performers have faced prosecution. Last summer, Aleksandr Dolgopolov fled Russia after he was threatened with criminal charges over a joke he made about President Vladimir Putin. And last month, the Interior Ministry banned comic Idrak Mirzalizade from the country for life after he made fun of habits he suggested many Russians share, though a court later suspended the ban. The latest episode in this crackdown appears to be taking place in the Primorye region of Russia's Far East, thousands of kilometers from Moscow and the epicenter of its stand-up scene. This week, a court in Ussuriisk, north of the regional capital, Vladivostok, sentenced two local actors to short jail stints because of their appearances in an online comedy sketch ribbing local officials and the ruling United Russia party. The show in question is a series of comedy sketches featuring Vitaly Nalivkin, a fictional official who brutishly harangues corrupt subordinates, fights forest fires, and trumpets various made-up draconic initiatives in Ussuriisk and surrounding areas, like forced vaccination at gunpoint. The show often alludes to actual Russian government policy, not always in a flattering way. On September 21, the actor who plays Nalivkin, Andrei Neretin, was jailed for two days on charges of ""disrespecting society"" after he allegedly cursed in a public place. Neretin was ultimately fined 500 rubles ($7). Two days later, an actress on the show was sentenced to 10 days in jail and fined 1,000 rubles ($14) for wearing a police uniform on set without official permission, a violation of Russian law. Larisa Krivonosova, 43, had played the role of Marina Vulf, a fictional Interior Ministry spokeswoman who local media report was a parody of real-life spokeswoman Irina Volk. The series has been airing online for more than two years and is wildly popular, with many episodes posted to YouTube gathering upwards of 2 million views. But coming in the wake of a major crackdown on dissent in Russia, which was stepped up in the weeks before parliamentary and local elections on September 17-19, it has clearly ruffled some feathers. The plot of its latest installment may give a clue as to why. In the episode, which has more than 700,000 views on YouTube, Nalivkin uses a rocket launcher in a bungled attempt to neutralize a hidden bomb that turns out to be a bag of carrots. In the process he destroys a banner promoting United Russia and replaces it with another -- which has an uncanny resemblance to a famous photo of Putin in which he sits in an armchair with his hands splayed, posing for a cover photograph for U.S. publication Time. Intimidation of comedians is not a new thing in Russia. During Putin's first term as president, between 2000 and 2004, the popular TV satire Kukly (Puppets) was removed from the air amid reports that Putin -- whom it parodied, among other officials -- had taken personal offense at his depiction. Exiting the Ussuriisk courthouse on September 23, Krivonosova told a local news site that she had previously had ""certain run-ins with law enforcement."" But she made no bones about what she suggested was the political nature of her jailing and fine. ""Clearly someone wasn't happy about my career trajectory,"" she said. ""Stars are made not in days, but in seconds."" The Siberia.Realities desk of RFE/RL's Russian Service contributed to this report"

Making a remote appearance from Canada for a proceeding of a federal district court in New York, Meng Wanzhou ""entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud,"" the department said in a press release. Under the terms of the deal, Meng, 49, confirmed the accuracy of a four-page statement of facts regarding her knowingly false statements to a financial institution, and could face prosecution on all charges if she breaches the agreement such as through further criminal conduct. For its part, the U.S. government withdrew its request that Meng be extradited from Canada. ""Our prosecution team continues to prepare for trial against Huawei, and we look forward to proving our case against the company in court,"" Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. of the department's Criminal Division was quoted as saying. In December 2018, Canada arrested Meng at the request of the United States, which has accused her of helping Huawei evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. Her detention became a source of tension between Beijing and Washington. Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, who is a former engineer in the Chinese military. His company is now known as a leader in the field of next-generation 5G mobile communications. China has pushed for Meng's immediate release by Canada for nearly three years. In apparent retaliation for her arrest, the Communist-led government has detained two Canadian citizens -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor."

According to the Cambridge and PHE team, in 2019 there were an estimated 105,200 people living with HIV in the UK, of whom 94% were aware of their HIV status. In addition, 98% of those living with diagnosed HIV were on treatment, and 97% of these were virally suppressed. In other words, England had already reached the UNAIDS goals. In a publication today in The Lancet Public Health, the researchers extended their analysis of evidence from multiple surveillance, demographic, and survey datasets relevant to HIV in England from estimating HIV prevalence in a single year to estimating the trends over time in HIV prevalence. Trends in the number of people living with HIV, the proportion of people unaware of their HIV infection, and the corresponding prevalence of undiagnosed HIV are reported. According to their analysis, the estimated number of people in England living with HIV aged 15-74 years who were unaware of their infection halved from 11,600 in 2013 to 5,900 in 2019, with a corresponding fall in prevalence from 0.29 to 0.14 per 1,000 people. At the same time, the increase in the number of people living with diagnosed HIV resulted in the total number of people living with HIV rising from 83,500 to 92,800 over the same period. The percentage of people living with HIV whose infection was diagnosed therefore steadily increased from 86% in 2013 to 94% in 2019, reaching the UNAIDS target in 2016 – and even earlier, in 2013, for Black African heterosexuals. Professor Daniela De Angelis from the MRC Biostatistics Unit, the study’s senior author, said: “Overall, we see a positive picture for the HIV epidemic in England, with a dramatic fall in the number of people living with undiagnosed HIV. We estimate we are already several years ahead of the UNAIDS 2020 goals and are on target to reach 95% diagnosed by 2025 and to eliminate HIV infections by 2030. Dr Anne Presanis from the MRC Biostatistics Unit added: “Examined more closely, the situation is not as positive for everyone. We estimate that areas of England outside London have not seen as steep a decrease in undiagnosed HIV prevalence as in London, and there is evidence of missed opportunities to diagnose HIV infections among some population subgroups.” In England, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, and Black African heterosexuals remain disproportionately affected by HIV, with considerably higher undiagnosed HIV prevalence per population in 2019 than heterosexuals in other ethnic groups. However, undiagnosed HIV prevalence rates within these communities have seen dramatic falls: for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, prevalence fell from 13.9 to 5.4 per 1,000, and for Black African heterosexuals prevalence fell from 3.3 to 1.7 per 1,000 population. London saw more dramatic falls in the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV during the study period than other regions of England, down from 0.74 to 0.31 per 1,000, compared to a decrease from 0.20 to 0.11 per 1,000 outside London. Although sexual health clinics provide free and confidential HIV testing to all clinic attendees, the researchers estimated that among heterosexuals in an ethnic group other than Black African, undiagnosed prevalence in clinic attendees in 2019 was more than 30 times greater than in those who had not attended in the past year. This implies that sexual health clinics are missing opportunities for testing attendees. This is in line with findings from Public Health England that among individuals outside those subgroups at greatest risk of HIV infection, the proportion declining a HIV test had increased to more than one in four (27%) in 2016. The researchers say their estimates have important implications for efforts to eliminate HIV transmission in England and the UK. Dr Valerie Delpech, head of the HIV Team at Public Health England said: “This research is good news and shows that combination prevention, and in particular HIV testing and early treatment, is working in England. The increasing use of pre-exposure prophylaxis among persons at higher risk of HIV has further amplified our response to end HIV transmission. Nevertheless, further reducing the number of people who remain undiagnosed with HIV infection will become very challenging in the coming years. This is particularly the case for heterosexuals who may not consider themselves at risk of HIV. “The priority must be to ensure that all sexual health clinic attendees are offered and encouraged to accept a HIV test, regardless of ethnicity, rather than the 73% that currently do test. If we can increase the number of clinic attendees unaware of their HIV status who get tested and diagnosed, as well as improve partner notification, the prospect of eliminating HIV transmission becomes increasingly likely.” The research was funded by the Medical Research Council and Public Health England.

And they are hoping to encourage more people to come forward between now and mid-October. What's known as forced or imposed sterilization has been documented in some other provinces, such as British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, but there is a ""glaring lack of relevant data"" in Quebec, according to the group. ""When you want to change something and you want to make it right … you have to first acknowledge the wrong that has been done,"" said Marjolaine Sioui, director general of the First Nations of Quebec and Labrador Health and Social Services Commission, one of the groups involved in the research.

Cree women among the partners Stella Masty Bearskin is the former chairperson of the Cree Women of Eeyou Istchee Association. (submitted by Stella Masty Bearskin) The term ""forced sterilization"" refers to the practice of sterilizing someone without their proper or informed consent, and sometimes without them ever being told, according to Stella Masty Bearskin, the former chairperson of the Cree Women of Eeyou Istchee Association, another partner in the research project. ''They went under the knife for something else … but at the same time, they would have the tubal ligation. This was something they didn't ask for,"" Masty Bearskin said. ""They would wonder why they couldn't have more children."" She said they also want to hear from any men who suspect they may be victims as well, as they have also heard stories of residential schools sterilizing young boys. Other partners in the research project include the Council of Elected Women of the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador (AFNQL), Quebec Native Women and the Cree and Nunavik health boards. For Cree women, two interviewers have been hired and are already collecting testimonies in Cree or English. A video about the research effort has also been produced.

Those behind the Quebec-focused study say they could join the class action or launch their own lawsuit once testimonies are collected and investigated.

The group, which includes Sunni and Shiites, youth activists and tribal leaders, said the next step after the dramatic announcement would be to seek “face-to-face talks” with Israelis. The 312 Iraqi men and women issued their statements from a hotel in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region. The conference was organized by the New York-based Center for Peace Communications, which works to advance engagement between Arabs and Israelis, and to protect activists supporting normalization. The Times of Israel is covering developments from the conference as they happen. One of the speakers explained that the group believes in peace with Israel “so that we might live in a stable region that brings conflicts to an end. We believe in it because we want our region to be a peaceful one, in which Israel is an inseparable part of the panoramic whole, and in which all peoples have the right to live in security.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We demand that Iraq join the Abraham Accords internationally,” wrote Wisam al-Hardan, leader of the Sons of Iraq Awakening movement, in The Wall Street Journal on Friday. “We call for full diplomatic relations with Israel and a new policy of mutual development and prosperity.” The Sons of Iraq formed organically in 2005 as tribal leaders in Anbar province and ex-Iraqi Army officers allied with US forces to fight al-Qaeda. “Some of us have faced down ISIS and al-Qaeda on the battlefield,” wrote Hardan. “Through blood and tears we have long demonstrated that we oppose all extremists, whether Sunni jihadists or Iran-backed Shi’ite militias. We have also demonstrated our patriotism: We sacrificed lives for the sake of a unified Iraq, aspiring to realize a federal system of government as stipulated in our nation’s constitution.” Advertisement Calling the expulsion of Iraq’s Jews “the most infamous act” in the country’s decline, Hardan said Iraq “must reconnect with the whole of our diaspora, including these Jews.” “We reject the hypocrisy in some quarters of Iraq that speaks kindly of Iraqi Jews while denigrating their Israeli citizenship, and the Jewish state, which granted them asylum.” Hardan also said that Iraq’s laws criminalizing contacts with Israelis are “morally repugnant.” He wrote that while countries like Syria, Libya, Lebanon and Yemen are mired in war, the Abraham Accords represent a hopeful trend of “peace, economic development, and brotherhood.” “We have a choice: tyranny and chaos, or legality, decency, peace and progress,” he wrote. “The answer is clear.” Seven working groups will be formed in the wake of the conference to address ties between Iraq and its Jewish diaspora, trade and investment, educational reform, repealing anti-normalization laws, peace communications in Iraqi media, artistic collaborations, and supporting peace activists in other Arab countries that don’t recognize Israel. Advertisement The Abraham Accords were signed on the White House lawn in September 2020 between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Morocco and Sudan signed normalization agreements with Israel in the ensuing months. Asked by Times of Israel for a response to the event in Iraq, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said: “The event in Iraq is a source of hope and optimism. Israel is always searching for ways to widen the circle of peace and we are working with friends across the world to make that happen.” “Normalization benefits the entire region and helps us move away from the extremism and chaos offered by negative actors towards stability, prosperity, moderation and cooperation. The Jewish people share a deep historical connection to Iraq. So to the Iraqi people we say today — we have far more that unites us than divides us and far more to gain from peace than from unnecessary conflict.” Iraq is officially at war with Israel and is a firm supporter of the Arab League boycott of Israel. Its passports are not valid for travel to Israel. In 2019, Iraqi ambassador in Washington Fareed Yasseen said, “There are objective reasons that may call for the establishment of relations between Iraq and Israel,” speaking in Arabic at an event entitled “How Iraq Is Dealing with the Current Regional and International Developments” at the Al-Hewar Center for Arab Culture and Dialogue in Washington. He noted that there is an important Iraqi community in Israel and they are still proud of their Iraqi attributes. “At their weddings, there is Iraqi culture of celebration. At their weddings, there are Iraqi songs,” the veteran diplomat, who has served in DC since November 2016, went on. Yasseen also noted “outstanding” Israeli technologies in the fields of water management and agriculture. “But the objective reasons are not enough,” he added, stressing that there are “emotional and other reasons” that make open communication between Jerusalem and Baghdad impossible. Though he faced backlash from other Iraqi officials, Yasseen was not recalled. The same year, three delegations of local leaders from Iraq reportedly made trips to Israel and held meetings with Israeli officials. Advertisement The delegations, totaling 15 Iraqis, met with Israeli academics, visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, and most significantly met with Israeli government officials, Hadashot TV news reported. In 2018, the Foreign Ministry launched a Facebook page uniquely dedicated to fostering ties with Iraq. Diplomats in Jerusalem said the Arabic-language page would serve as “some sort of digital embassy” to the war-torn country. Israel had in recent months stepped up efforts to reach out to the country, arguing that Iraqis were interested in establishing ties with the Jewish state. A month later, Iraq’s representative at the 2017 Miss Universe pageant — whose Instagram photo last year with her Israeli counterpart forced her family to flee the Middle Eastern country — visited Israel and reunited with Miss Israel. In August of this year, a senior Foreign Ministry official said that Israel maintains some form of contact with Iraq. While Israel maintained close ties with Iraqi Kurdish leaders in the 1960s and 1970s, Iraq was one of Israel’s leading adversaries until the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. Iraq’s 18,000 troops represented the largest single force fighting the nascent Jewish state in the 1948 War of Independence, even defeating Israeli forces in Jenin. Iraq also sent major expeditionary forces to fight Israel in 1967 and 1973, losing over 800 soldiers to IDF forces on the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War. Saddam Hussein’s secret nuclear weapons program alarmed Israel, which ultimately destroyed the Osirak reactor in Iraq in 1981. During the 1991 Gulf War, Hussein targeted the Jewish state with dozens of Scud missiles."

You have full access to this article via your institution. Rhinolophus bats roosting in a cave in Thailand.Credit: Getty Scientists have found three viruses in bats in Laos that are more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than any known viruses. Researchers say that parts of their genetic code bolster claims that the virus behind COVID-19 has a natural origin — but their discovery also raises fears that there are numerous coronaviruses with the potential to infect people. David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow, UK, calls the find “fascinating, and quite terrifying”. The results, which are not peer reviewed, have been posted on the preprint server Research Square1. Particularly concerning is that the new viruses contain receptor binding domains that are almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, and can therefore infect human cells. The receptor binding domain allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach to a receptor called ACE2 on the surface of human cells to enter them. To make the discovery, Marc Eloit, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and his colleagues in France and Laos, took saliva, faeces and urine samples from 645 bats in caves in northern Laos. In three horseshoe (Rhinolophus) bat species, they found viruses that are each more than 95% identical to SARS-CoV-2, which they named BANAL-52, BANAL-103 and BANAL-236. Natural origin “When SARS-CoV-2 was first sequenced, the receptor binding domain didn’t really look like anything we’d seen before,” says Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. This caused some people to speculate that the virus had been created in a laboratory. But the Laos coronaviruses confirm these parts of SARS-CoV-2 exist in nature, he says. “I am more convinced than ever that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural origin,” agrees Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore. Together with relatives of SARS-CoV-2 discovered in Thailand2, Cambodia3 and Yunnan in southern China4, the study demonstrates that southeast Asia is a “hotspot of diversity for SARS-CoV-2 related viruses”, says Alice Latinne, an evolutionary biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society Vietnam in Hanoi. In an extra step in their study, Eloit and his team showed in the laboratory that the receptor binding domains of these viruses could attach to the ACE2 receptor on human cells as efficiently as some early variants of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers also cultured BANAL-236 in cells, which Eloit says they will now use to study how pathogenic the virus is in animal models. Last year, researchers described another close relative of SARS-CoV-2, called RaTG13, which was found in bats in Yunnan5. It is 96.1% identical to SARS-CoV-2 overall and the two viruses probably shared a common ancestor 40–70 years ago6. BANAL-52 is 96.8% identical to SARS-CoV-2, says Eloit — and all three newly discovered viruses have individual sections that are more similar to sections of SARS CoV-2 than seen in any other viruses. Viruses swap chunks of RNA with one another through a process called recombination, and one section in BANAL-103 and BANAL-52 could have shared an ancestor with sections of SARS-CoV-2 less than a decade ago, says Spyros Lytras, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Glasgow. “These viruses recombine so much that different bits of the genome have different evolutionary histories,” he says. Missing links The Laos study offers insight into the origins of the pandemic, but there are still missing links, say researchers. For example, the Laos viruses don’t contain the so-called furin cleavage site on the spike protein that further aids the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses into human cells. The study also doesn’t clarify how a progenitor of the virus could have travelled to Wuhan, in central China, where the first known cases of COVID-19 were identified — or whether the virus hitched a ride on an intermediate animal. Answers might come from sampling more bats and other wildlife in southeast Asia, which many groups are doing. Another preprint, also posted on Research Square and not yet peer reviewed, sheds light on the work under way in China7. For that study, researchers sampled some 13,000 bats between 2016 and 2021 across China. But they did not find any close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, and conclude that these are “extremely rare in bats in China”. But other researchers question this claim. “I strongly disagree with the suggestion that relatives of SARS-CoV-2 may not be circulating in Chinese bats, as such viruses have already been described in Yunnan,” says Holmes. The corresponding author of the study declined to respond to Nature’s questions about the findings, because the paper is still under review. Wang says that both studies highlight the importance of ramping up sampling in regions outside China to help uncover the origins of the pandemic."

SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE TO ASIA MARKETS Guangzhou R&F Properties (HKG: 2777) Headquartered in Zhujiang New City, Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd has FY2020 attributable contracted sales of around $21 billion. It has residential apartments and other major property projects across China and internationally. It is also the world’s largest luxury hotel owner. It’s cooperative brands include Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, Crowne Plaza, Meridien, Pullman, Holiday Inn, Sofitel, Conrad, Westin and The Ritz-Carlton. Analysis of its latest financials (to June 30, 2021), show Guangzhou R&F Properties has a debt to equity ratio of just below 160%. This compares to China Evergrande with a debt to equity ratio of just below 140%. We’ve ranked the top listed Chinese property development companies by leverage below. We believe these 7 are not only China’s most leveraged residential property developers, but more than likely the 7 most leveraged residential property developers in the world. For reference, the United States’ largest homebuilder, D.r. Horton Inc (NYSE: DHI) has a debt to equity ratio of 31.4%. Asia Markets is not suggesting Guangzhou R&F Properties is unable to meet its debt obligations. In its 2021 Interim Results Announcement, the company noted liquidity concerns stemming from credit market volatility and increasing oversight from the Chinese Government. “China continues to undergo adjustments in policies that affect the property sector and there is increasing oversight to ensure the stable and healthy development of the property sector, but policy fluctuation will affect the overall liquidity management to a certain extent,” said the company. “In addition to industry regulations, overall credit markets in the first half have been quite volatile, making it more uncertain as to available sources of financing. “However, the Group still managed to make significant improvements in credit profile during this period. In the first half, the Group reduced total borrowings by RMB16.4 billion, and secured RMB25.7 billion of financing to refinance existing indebtedness and enhance available liquidity. “The capital raising achieved allowed the Group to address short-term maturities and demonstrates our ability to manage liquidity during tight credit environments. “The Group expects challenges in financing markets persist, hence, the Group will continue striving to maintain and explore financing channels to further improve the future credit profile.” Year-to-date the company’s share price is down -48.5%, with a market cap just short of $19 billion. Unchartered waters for Evergrande Evergrande yesterday missed a deadline for a $83.5 million coupon payment on one of it many offshore bonds. The company is now navigating a 30-day grace period before the missed payment is considered a default. Meanwhile, Evergrande’s Hong Kong-listed electric vehicle division, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, has just released a dire market update. “As of the date of this announcement, the Group is encountering serious shortage of funds. In view of the liquidity pressure, the Group has suspended paying some of its operating expenses and some suppliers have suspended supplying for projects,” said the update. “There is no guarantee that the Group will be able to meet its financial obligations under the relevant contracts.” Here’s the full announcement:"

Hunters sparked widespread outrage last week when they wiped out a super-pod of 1,428 dolphins — believed to be the worst mammal massacre in the islands’ history. Just 10 days later, they responded to global revulsion by slaughtering 53 pilot whales just miles from the first massacre. Wildlife activist Dominic Dyer has called on ministers to suspend the £580 million post-Brexit deal the government agreed with the Faroe Islands in 2019 “until the slaughter ends for good”. In three days, more than 21,000 people signed a petition on the government’s website to support the plea. The government told The independent it is “extremely concerned about the impact on the sustainability and welfare of the animals involved in these hunts”, but that it would not revise the trade agreement. Instead, it says it will “continue to engage in a frank and respectful dialogue” with the Faroese government. Zac Goldsmith, the animal welfare minister, tweeted about the dolphin killings: “This is one of the most sickening spectacles I have ever seen. It shames our species.” The annual hunt, known as the “Grindadrap”, consists of herding whales and dolphins to a beach where they are stabbed to death as their blood stains the sea red. The practice has been branded “barbaric,” “sick” and “sadistic,” but those who defend it say it’s a tradition that doesn’t risk driving the animals to extinction. Mr Dyer said: “We are currently granting the Faroe Islands a preferential trade deal worth more than £500 million a year – it is time for sanctions to stop this barbarity.” The deal accounts for more than 25 percent of the Faroe Islands’ global trade, he said, with the islands’ exports – mainly fish sold in UK supermarkets – worth £582 million a year. Britain’s exports to the islands are at £34 million, said Mr Dyer, whose petition reads: “If the UK wants to be considered a world leader in marine mammal conservation, it must use this lever now.” When asked by The independent or agree to suspend or review the deal, the Department for International Trade said it had no plans to do so. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “The UK strongly opposes the hunting of cetaceans and continues to call on all whaling countries, including the Faroe Islands, to stop hunting for cetaceans at every appropriate opportunity. cetaceans. whaling activities in favor of well-managed, responsible tourism, such as whale watching. “We recognize that there is a long tradition in the Faroe Islands of killing pilot whales and dolphins for meat and other products, and we want to continue our frank conversations about cetacean conservation to encourage them to stop hunting.” Government policy is to maintain “diplomatic pressure” on the islands to end the hunt and reconnect with the International Whaling Commission. Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie, and his father, Stanley, have previously participated in anti-whaling campaigns outside the Japanese embassy in London."

Images of the latest haul were snapped by a Faroese local on Wednesday evening (local time) and shared to conservation group Sea Shepherd. Blood can be seen trickling from the bodies of pilot whales which are lined up in neat rows along a drain, after they were killed in waters off the tiny Faroe Islands village of Kollafjordur. An estimated 52 pilot whales were killed by Faroese hunters on Wednesday. Source: Sea Shepherd Speaking with Yahoo News Australia from Denmark this morning, Sea Shepherd’s Valentina Crast said the situation had left her and many of the islanders feeling “shocked and angry”. “We have a few local volunteers who are anonymous, but are very committed to documenting what they can and sharing it with us so we can get it out to the world,” she said. “These new images were done by a local who really wants us to end these killings.” Key facts about dolphin slaughter on the Faroe Islands Dolphin and whale slaughter knowns as ""grindadrap"" translates as “murder of whales” Sea Shepherd has been campaigning against the hunt since the 1980s The grindadrap likely dates back 1200 years Modern aids like motorboats are used today to help islanders herd whales and dolphins Whales could be seen lined up ready to be butchered for their meat. Source: Sea Shepherd What you need to know about the slaughter of almost 1500 dolphins Surprise at whale slaughter despite worldwide outrage at 'tradition' Reports suggest 52 whales were butchered overnight, leaving observers “surprised” that it would occur so soon after their last major hunt attracted worldwide attention. The “dolphin massacre”, as it was dubbed, led to unprecedented outrage among locals across the Faroe Islands, a self-governing Danish territory, with a survey suggesting over 50 per cent of respondents want dolphin killing to end. Story continues Known locally as the grindadrap (murder of whales), the annual hunt dates back 1200 years, and is a fiercely protected tradition on the island, however even the territory’s hunt chairman Heri Petersen condemned this month’s record-breaking dolphin slaughter. He told local media he did not know the incident was taking place, and that it would damage the regions’ reputation. The survey indicated support for pilot whale killing remains strong, with 80 per cent of Faroese saying the annual migrational hunts should continue. Video showed knives used to slaughter dolphins as locals, including children, watched on. Source: Sea Shepherd Health authorities recommend locals eat no more than 200 grams of whale or dolphin flesh a month, due to high levels of contaminants in the flesh, meaning the dolphins killed earlier this month were more than enough to feed the islands’ 50,000 residents. Sea Shepherd calculate that less than 300 whales could feed the entire archipelago, but this year 667 pilot whales and 1428 dolphins have been killed. Unlike the Japanese dolphin hunters in Taiji who must comply with a quota, there are no restrictions imposed by either Denmark or the European Union on the number of cetaceans the Faroese can kill. “The Faroese have no quota for the grindadrap hunts, no season, no need for the meat and it seems no compassion,” Sea Shepherd’s Rob Read told Yahoo News Australia. Over the last decade, figures indicate the Faroese have killed 6,276 long-finned pilot whales, 24 northern bottlenose whales and 2,654 Atlantic white sided dolphins. Do you have a story tip?

""It is 561 days since we introduced the toughest measures in Norway in peacetime ... Now the time has come to return to a normal daily life,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference. The decision to no longer require social distancing will allow culture and sports venues to utilise their full capacity, rather than just a portion of seats, while restaurants can fill up and nightclubs reopen. Ms Solberg had so far implemented the first three stages of a four-step plan to remove social and economic restrictions imposed since March of last year, but the final step was postponed several times amid worries over infection rates. ""In short, we can now live as normal,"" Ms Solberg said. About 76% of all Norwegians have now received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 67% of the population is fully vaccinated according to the Institute of Public Health. ""I want to say: thank you very much Norway,"" the Prime Minister added. Australia hits Covid vaccine milestone More than half of Australia's adult population are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Authorities are stepping up inoculations in hopes of easing restrictions while cases linger near daily record levels in Victoria. Australia is grappling with a third wave of infections from the highly infectious Delta variant that has led to lockdowns in its two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and the capital, Canberra, affecting nearly half the country's 25 million people. These tough curbs and a decision to shut construction sites for two weeks over the rapid spread of the virus among workers triggered anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne during the week. Police arrested more than 200 today for theft, drug offences and breaching stay-at-home orders, authorities said, as small groups of protesters gathered throughout the afternoon at various locations. As most of Australia's southeast remains under strict stay-at-home restrictions, virus-free Western Australia is gearing up to host the Australian Rules Football Grand Final for the first time, in front of 60,000 fans at Perth Stadium tomorrow. Victoria today reported one new death and 733 new infections, its second biggest daily rise in the pandemic, down from the record high of 766 yesterday. Most cases were detected in Melbourne. Both New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian leaders have pledged more freedom to residents once full vaccinations in people older than 16 reach 70%, which is expected next month. So far, 57% have been fully vaccinated in NSW, above the national average of 50.1%. Two million doses were administered in the country in the last seven days. Daily cases may have stabilised in NSW, the epicentre of the country's worst outbreak, as it reported 1,043 new infections, down from 1,063 yesterday. ""We are seeing pleasing declines ... hopefully we will see numbers decrease in coming days and weeks,"" state Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said during a media briefing in Sydney. But officials flagged any easing of curbs in NSW would be done ""cautiously and moderately"" when the state hits its 70% dual-dose target, around 6 October, to avoid spikes in cases that could overwhelm its health systems. Even with the fast-moving Delta outbreak, Australia has largely avoided high numbers seen in many comparable countries, with about 94,000 cases and 1,208 deaths, and the death rate is lower than last year because of higher vaccination rates. Elsewhere, Norway will reopen society tomorrow, ending pandemic-curbing restrictions that have limited social interaction and hobbled many businesses. ""It is 561 days since we introduced the toughest measures in Norway in peacetime ... Now the time has come to return to a normal daily life,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference."

Spanish daily El País said last week that Brexit, worker shortages and the pandemic are hitting supplies in the United Kingdom. Referencing shortages that plagued Britain in the 1970s, eventually leading to the arrival of Margaret Thatcher’s neoliberalism, the newspaper said Britain is returning to the days when it was “not uncommon to make excuses for breach of contract.” ‘Like a boycotted Cuba’ Also in Spain, La Vanguardia talks about KFC struggling to find chickens and having to close branches and McDonald’s not serving milkshakes and soft drinks. It continues highlighting medicines are expiring before even arriving in British hospitals and pharmacies, fruits and vegetables are rotting in the fields, pubs are finding it hard to get hold of beer and water bottles are “evaporating”. “In many many shops and supermarkets there isn’t milk, and the image of empty shelves has become usual, as if it were a boycotted Cuba,” the paper reported earlier this month.

In a statement received by AFP, BP admits that it is “suffering from petrol supply problems at some sales sites in the United Kingdom”, caused by “delivery delays due to the lack of truck drivers across the UK”. ‘No one to transport fuel’ In Germany, Der Spiegel also reported yesterday about petrol shortagres, saying: “There would be enough fuel available – but nobody is there to transport it”. Italy’s Repubblica TV talked about “Great Britain’s post-Brexit apocalipse” earlier this month.

The trio, who have been running CovidbaseAU, became part of their own statistics after getting their first doses of the Moderna vaccine in Melbourne. The identities of the brains trust behind CovidbaseAU had not been public before Thursday afternoon, when 14-year-old Wesley with Jack and Darcy, both 15, tweeted a photograph of themselves. BOOM! 12-15s can get the💉  Today the three of us who run @covidbaseau, Jack, Wesley and Darcy, had our first dose of the Moderna vaccine.🎉  Thought this would be a good time to share who we really are.😄  Thrilled that we will finally be included in our data! pic.twitter.com/SeIQFXPjGW — CovidBaseAU 🦠📊🇦🇺 (@covidbaseau) September 23, 2021 They said they looked forward to joining the 25.30% of 12- to 15-year-olds in Victoria who had received at least one dose of vaccine. CovidbaseAU has been tracking Covid-19 statistics since April 2021, breaking down Australian and global data on infections, hospitalisations, deaths and vaccinations. The Melbourne teenagers told ABC TV on Friday the project was initially planned in February “just for fun”. It was a means to pursue their interests in coding and the media. “Being really interested in data, we decided to take what we’ve been doing and create something with it. We spend a lot of time on it to try to make it as comprehensive as possible,” Jack said. Eight state and territory governments, as well as the federal government regularly release Covid-19 data, often in different locations and formats. Darcy said he wanted to “put it together and display it on a website so it’s accessible for everyone”. Looking forward to being added to that 25.30% tomorrow😁 pic.twitter.com/2O3rnOVQb8 — CovidBaseAU 🦠📊🇦🇺 (@covidbaseau) September 23, 2021 As the vaccination rollout, and Covid cases, ramped up across the nation, their social media feed and website continued to pick up pace. They have amassed more than 25,000 Twitter followers. Now no longer a hobby project, the site the teenagers built and operate hosts a wealth of data – breaking down Australian cases by state and local government area. It includes detailed information such as the percentage of cases that end up in hospital or intensive care units. It’s not an easy job, and CovidBaseAU requires a trio to run smoothly. Jack has always been the data guy, Darcy is the coder and Wesley is the all-rounder – keeping on top of events, making infographics and emojis. “Right now, we’re in Melbourne and we’re in lockdown so that’s sort of given us a lot of time to be able to do things more freely … we do get all our school stuff done, don’t worry, but it’s a bit a juggling act,” Jack told ABC TV. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nick Evershed, the data and interactives editor at Guardian Australia, said CovidBaseAU had done impressive work collating hard-to-find information. “There has been a few occasions, particularly with the numbers around vaccine imports and supply, where I’ve cross-checked my numbers against theirs,” he said. “They did a really good job at combing through all the disparate media releases and press conferences in the early stages of the rollout to piece together a good picture of how many doses Australia was producing or importing at various points, which was extremely helpful as I was compiling similar data.” Jack, Wesley and Darcy were praised by fellow Twitter users after revealing their identities, amassing more than 16,000 likes in a 24-hour period, as well as a part-time job offer from the head of public health at the Burnet Institute. “You three pull off some awesome work!” Ben Krauth wrote. Prof Mark Stoove added: “Nice work boys! Need a part-time job?” To the latter tweet, Jack replied that he usually worked in a restaurant (but not during lockdown) while Darcy did some work on thermal modelling. Wesley wasn’t yet 15 “but thanks!”, Jack wrote. The CovidbaseAU Twitter handle is regularly cited by mainstream media as a data source. “We did expect it to do fairly well, but what has happened is really mind-blowing. We’ve got, I think, on Twitter, the last time I checked, over 14,000 likes. That’s absolutely madness for us,” Jack said on Friday. The trio was buoyed by the fact it was the act of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine – the jab they’ve been tracking for months on end and the ticket out of the pandemic – that generated so much interest. “I know a lot of my friends, just around my age, they’re all very keen [to get vaccinated]. I think it’s great to see the sort of real excitement around it,” Jack said."

Planes have been grounded on the island of La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands due to a fresh volcanic eruption, in the first cancellation of flights since the Cumbre Vieja volcano came to life this week. New evacuations were also ordered on Friday as large explosions and new openings were reported at the volcano, which spewed a large cloud of thick, black ash into the air. There were seven flights scheduled for Friday operated by Binter, Canaryfly and the national carrier, Iberia, but all were scrapped. “It is not yet possible to say when we can resume flights,” Spanish carrier Binter said on Twitter. Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque, reporting from La Palma, described the scene as “a giant smouldering cauldron”. “No one knows what scenario comes next … The cloud of ash shoots up, cancelling all flights in the area … When the second crater erupted, we heard a sonic boom, windows shutter, a real sense of fear of what is to come,” he said. Authorities also ordered new evacuations, adding to the 6,100 people already forced to leave the area this week following Sunday’s eruption.   The compulsory evacuation order was issued in parts of La Palma island “given the increased risk for the population due to the current eruptive episode”, the regional government said. Video footage from the civil guard showed a garden in the area completely covered in thick ash. The speed of the lava flowing from the mouth of the volcano has steadily slowed its pace in recent days, and experts are hoping it will not reach the coast. If the molten lava reaches the sea, experts fear it will generate clouds of toxic gas into the air, which will also affect the marine environment. Authorities set up a no-go zone this week to head off curious onlookers. Estimated damage Hundreds of homes and large swaths of land have been destroyed by the eruption, and regional authorities estimate the damage to be more than 400 million euros ($470m). No casualties have been reported so far. The Spanish government plans to designate the island a disaster zone and to draw up a comprehensive reconstruction plan, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday. The eruption on the island of La Palma, home to about 85,000 people, was the first in 50 years. The last eruption was in 1971 when another part of the same volcanic range – a vent known as Teneguia – erupted on the southern side of the island. More than 20 years earlier, the Nambroque vent erupted in 1949.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly via video link from the West Bank, Abbas urged countries to act to save the two-state formula that for decades has been the bedrock of diplomacy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas said Israel was ""destroying the prospect of a political settlement based on the two-state solution"" through its settlements on West Bank land it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the settlements as illegal, a position Israel disputes. Abbas threatened to rescind the Palestinians' recognition of Israel if it does not withdraw from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem within a year. ""If this is not achieved, why maintain recognition of Israel based on the 1967 borders? Why maintain this recognition?"" Abbas asked. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United States, denounced 85-year-old Abbas's comments, accusing the Palestinians of refusing peace with Israel. ""Abu Mazen’s (Abbas) speech was full of lies,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Those who truly support peace and negotiations do not threaten delusional ultimatums."" In his U.N. address, Abbas accused Israel of imposing apartheid on Palestinians, repeating an accusation that Israel rejects. ""Circumstances on the ground will inevitably impose equal and full political rights for all on the land of historical Palestine, within one state. In all cases, Israel has to choose,"" Abbas said from Ramallah, the seat of his Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in the West Bank. Critics say internal Palestinian divisions have also contributed to the deadlock in U.S.-sponsored peace talks, which collapsed in 2014. Under interim peace accords with Israel, Abbas's Palestinian Authority was meant to exercise control in Gaza as well. But his Islamist rivals Hamas seized the coastal enclave in 2007 and years of on-and-off talks have failed to break their impasse. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a far-rightist who sits atop a cross-partisan coalition, will address the assembly on Monday. He opposes Palestinian statehood but his government has vowed to avoid sensitive decisions towards the Palestinians and instead focus on economic issues. While some Palestinians and Israelis support the idea of a single binational state, most have very different ideas of what that entity would look like and how it would be governed. Most analysts contend a single state would not be viable, for religious, political and demographic reasons. Israeli governments have viewed a one-state concept as undermining the essence of an independent Jewish state. U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated his support for the two-state solution during his own U.N. address on Tuesday, saying it would ensure ""Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable and democratic Palestinian state."" loading Reporting by Ali Sawafta and Zainah El-Haroun, Editing by Rami Ayyub, Nick Macfie and Grant McCool Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The ride hailing company was forced to guarantee its 70,000 UK drivers a minimum hourly wage, holiday pay and pensions in March this year after a landmark supreme court ruling over their employment status. Couriers for the group’s UberEats food delivery service are not included in the deal. On Friday, Uber said its private hire drivers would now be auto-enrolled on to a scheme through which it would contribute 3% of earnings into a pension pot. Drivers can choose to contribute up to 5% of qualifying earnings but will be able to opt out. Drivers will also receive back payments dating back to 1 May 2017 or the date of their first trip if they joined more recently. Uber, whose scheme is provided by NOW: Pensions and managed by Adecco, called on rival operators to help create a cross-industry scheme so that drivers who worked across several apps would always benefit. Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager of northern and eastern Europe, said: “We want to ensure that all eligible drivers can benefit no matter who they earn with, so today I am extending an invitation to work with operators such as Bolt, Addison Lee and Ola to create a cross-industry pension scheme.” Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which agreed a recognition deal with Uber in May, said: “Uber’s pension scheme is a massive step in the right direction and will no doubt help thousands of drivers as they reach retirement age. GMB urges other platform-based operators to follow Uber’s lead.” James Farrer, general secretary of the ADCU union, said: “Uber’s 3% pension contribution is welcome but it falls far short of what drivers deserve. Poor pay and Uber’s failure to pay waiting time continue to be a huge source of discontent for the workforce, which is why the ADCU is staging a 24-hour Uber driver strike across eight UK cities on 28 September.” Uber’s deal comes after a supreme court ruling found the ride hailing group’s private hire drivers should be classed as workers, with rights to minimum hourly pay, holiday pay and a pension. The company had previously classed them as independent self-employed contractors with few rights. In May, the UK’s pension regulator said it was working closely with Uber on its scheme and called on all gig economy companies to recognise the employment rights of those who work for them and set up workplace pensions."

Months after crops were burned and communities stripped bare, a new kind of death has set in. At a health center last week, a mother and her newborn weighing just 1.7 pounds died from hunger. In every district of the more than 20 where one aid group works, residents have starved to death. ALSO READ | The floating dead of Ethiopia: 'Hands tied, they were shot in chest, abdomen and legs' For months, the United Nations has warned of famine in this embattled corner of northern Ethiopia, calling it the world’s worst hunger crisis in a decade. Now internal documents and witness accounts reveal the first starvation deaths since Ethiopia’s government in June imposed what the UN calls “a de facto humanitarian aid blockade.” Scroll down to see photos: 1 Dying of hunger  At least 150 people starved to death last month in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region amid a near-complete blockade of food aid by federal and allied authorities, the Tigray forces say, while close to half a million people face famine conditions. (AP) 2 'I just cry'  “You are killing people,” Hayelom Kebede, the former director of Tigray’s flagship Ayder Referral Hospital, recalled telling Ethiopia’s health ministry in a phone call this month. “They said, ‘Yeah, OK, we’ll forward it to the prime minister.’ What can I do? I just cry.” (AP) 3 On brink of famine  More than 350,000 metric tons of food aid are positioned in Ethiopia, but very little of it can get into Tigray. The government is so wary that humanitarian workers boarding rare flights to the region have been given an unusual list of items they cannot bring: Dental flossers. Can openers. Multivitamins. Medicines, even personal ones. (AP) 4 'Skin color was beginning to change due to hunger'  In April, even before the current blockade was imposed, an aid group wrote to the donor that “reports of malnourishment are rampant,” and that 22 people in one sub-district had starved to death. “People’s skin color was beginning to change due to hunger; they looked emaciated with protruding skeletal bones,” the aid group wrote. (AP) 5 As war spreads, so might hunger  There is little help coming. The UN says at least 100 trucks with food and other supplies must reach Tigray every day to meet people’s needs. But as of September 8, fewer than 500 had arrived since July on the only accessible road into the region. No medical supplies or fuel have been delivered to Tigray in more than a month, the US says, blaming “government harassment” and decisions, not the fighting. (AP)"

The mobile phones of at least five French ministers and a diplomatic advisor to President Emmanuel Macron were infected by the Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, sources told AFP on Friday, confirming a report by the Mediapart investigative website. Advertising Read more French security services detected the software while inspecting the phones, with the intrusions believed to have taken place in 2019 and 2020, according to the report from Mediapart on Friday. Pegasus, made by the Israeli firm NSO Group, can switch on a phone's camera or microphone and harvest its data, and was at the centre of a storm in July after a list of about 50,000 potential surveillance targets worldwide was leaked to the media. The media consortium behind the revelations, including The Washington Post, The Guardian and France's Le Monde, reported at the time that one of Macron's phone numbers and those of many French cabinet ministers were on the leaked list of potential targets. French authorities declined to comment on Friday. The five ministers targeted are Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, Territorial Cohesion Minister Jacqueline Gourault, Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie, Housing Minister Emmanuelle Wargon and Overseas Territories Minister Sebastien Lecornu, Mediapart said. Two French sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed the veracity of the report, while asking not to be identified by name because they were not authorised to speak to the media. ""My phone is one of those checked out by the national IT systems security agency, but I haven't yet heard anything about the investigation so I cannot comment at this stage,"" Wargon told the L'Opinion website Friday. One of her aides told AFP that ""the minister doesn't have access to any state secrets, so we can't really see the point of spying on her."" In July, Le Monde reported that evidence of an attempted hacking was found on the phone of the former environment minister and close Macron ally Francois de Rugy, with the attempt allegedly originating in Morocco. Morocco's intelligence services were also accused of being behind the hacking of journalists in France, but the kingdom's government has denied the claims and launched legal action alleging defamation.

If the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), hard-left Linke and environmentalist Greens come to power, the reintroduction of a wealth tax and a tightening of inheritance tax could be on the political agenda. ""For the super-rich, this is red hot,"" said a German-based tax lawyer with extensive Swiss operations. ""Entrepreneurial families are highly alarmed."" The move shows how many rich people still see Switzerland as an attractive place to park wealth, despite its efforts to abolish its image as a billionaires' safe haven. No country has more offshore assets than Switzerland and inflows accelerated in 2020, to the benefit of big banks such as UBS (UBSG.S), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Julius Baer (BAER.S). Geopolitical tensions and fears of the COVID-19 pandemic's economic fallout made Switzerland's political stability attractive. Bank for International Settlements data show deposits of German households and companies at banks in Switzerland climbed almost $5 billion to $37.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, and this does not include shares, bonds or financial products. More recent figures are not available, but insiders say the inflows have continued. ""I have booked an above-average amount of new money as in the past three months,"" said a veteran client adviser at a large Swiss bank who deals mainly with Germans. ""Many wealthy people, especially entrepreneurs, fear that there will be a lurch to the left in Germany - no matter how the elections turn out,"" says Florian Dürselen, head of Europe at wealth manager LGT Switzerland. One top Swiss banker said: ""I know a number of German entrepreneurs who want to have a foothold outside Germany if things get too red (leftist) there."" 1/4 Women relax on the banks of Lake Zurich on a sunny spring day, as the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues, in Zurich, Switzerland March 23, 2021. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/ Read More TAX ON ASSETS A poll on Thursday showed the SPD, on 25%, leading outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives by four points. The SPD wants to reintroduce a wealth tax and increase inheritance tax, while the Greens - a likely potential coalition partner - plan to tax fortunes more heavily. Although both envision raising income tax for top earners, a tax on assets would raise much more money, the tax lawyer said. He was seeing increased demand for advice from clients, he said, noting some entrepreneurs had sought to protect themselves by making new investments through a company in Switzerland or transferring assets to a foundation in Liechtenstein. Simply transferring cash to a Swiss bank account, on the other hand, no longer helps. Under immense international pressure, the Swiss now share such account data with tax authorities in clients' home countries. ""Switzerland as a financial centre is characterized by stability, legal security and a high level of financial competence. However, it does not offer any protection against tax evasion,"" said a spokesperson for the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF). LGT's Dürselen said he recently spoke with a German entrepreneur who feared Germany could soon tax foreign assets or transactions harshly, which fostered the view of Switzerland as a safe haven for capital. ""Personally, I assume that considerable assets will continue to be moved to Switzerland,"" he said. One local politician said dozens of wealthy German entrepreneurs have inquired in recent months about residing in one of the low-tax suburbs along Lake Zurich.

The strike takes place five weeks before the U.N. COP26 summit, which aims to secure more ambitious climate action from world leaders to drastically cut the greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet. ""The concentration of CO2 in the sky hasn't been this high for at least 3 million years,"" Swedish activist Greta Thunberg told a crowd of thousands of protesters in the German capital. ""It is clearer than ever that no political party is doing close to enough."" Demonstrations were planned in more than 1,500 locations by youth movement Fridays for Future, kicking off in Asia with small-scale demonstrations in the Philippines and Bangladesh, and spreading throughout the day to European cities including Warsaw, Turin and Berlin.

Firefighters pulled out of clean-up work in the town of Todoque on Friday afternoon as a new vent opened up in the flank of the volcano and videos shared on social media showed a massive shockwave emanating from the eruption site.

Authorities ordered the evacuation of the towns of Tajuya, Tacande de Abajo and the part of Tacande de Arriba that had not already been evacuated on Friday afternoon, with residents told to assemble at the local football ground. Canary Islands emergency services had initially told residents to stay indoors to avoid the dense cloud of ash and lava fragments but later decided to evacuate due to the heightened risk from explosions. It wasn't just people being evacuated, but animals too. ""The evacuation of people is the main priority ... although there are also other important tasks such as keeping pets safe,"" the Guardia Civil tweeted, with a video showing officers carrying reluctant goats to safety.

The government and parliament approved marriage for same-sex couples last year, allowing them to adopt children not parented by either partner, giving lesbian couples access to sperm donation, and simplifying citizenship for foreign spouses. The move was immediately challenged by a trio of nationalist and conservative Christian parties, which objected to the extension of same-sex couples’ rights beyond a basic civil partnership that has been legal in Switzerland since 2007. Under the Swiss constitution, any parliamentary decision can be submitted to a referendum if at least 50,000 citizens demand it. Opponents of the new law, many of them supporters of the populist rightwing Swiss People’s party (SVP/UDC), have used stark posters of crying babies, decrying the commodification of children and warning the law will “kill the father”. Thierry Delessert, an expert on the history of homosexuality in Switzerland at Lausanne university, said the change would represent “a huge step forward” in a country in which, although it decriminalised homosexuality in 1942, local and regional police continued to keep “gay registers”, in some cases into the early 1990s. “If a supposed homosexual was convicted of theft, his homosexuality was submitted as additional proof of his immorality,” Delessert told Agence-France Presse. “If a homosexual applied to rent an apartment, he would not get it. If a homosexual wanted a job in the public sector, he would not get it.” A referendum early last year approved the criminalisation of homophobic acts, and the legalisation of same-sex marriage would bring Switzerland in line with most western European countries, with Italy only other major country where it is not legal. The Netherlands was the first EU country to change its marriage laws 20 years ago, with Germany and Austria becoming the latest in 2017 and 2019. Same-sex marriage is still illegal, however, in many eastern European countries, and is outlawed by the constitution in Poland and Hungary. Corinne Guntern and Anouk Oswald said the Marriage for All vote represented an important milestone. “I want to be able to choose for myself if I want to marry this partner next to me and if it’s the right path for us to start a family,” said Oswald, 30. Guntern, also 30, said it was not fair that a single woman could adopt a child while a same-sex couple could not. “Today, if I reach a certain age and I’m single, regardless of my sexual orientation, I can be accepted into the adoption process.” As someone in a same-sex partneship, she told Reuters, she currently could not. “Of course, a child needs safety and love, she said. “But I don’t think it makes a difference whether that’s given by a straight or gay couple.” Polls show support for the law, which is also opposed by a small evangelical party, EDU/UDF, and the conservative Christian democrat Die Mitte/Le Centre party, at about 63%, with about 35% set to vote against it."

""I thought that if I made it through three waves without getting infected, I can make it through another one without a vaccine,"" Pascu said, her voice so weak that she could barely speak. Whereas the European Union has fully vaccinated 72% of its adult population on the whole, Romania has only managed 34%, exposing entrenched distrust in state institutions, misinformation campaigns, poor rural infrastructure and weak vaccine education. The government, which eased restrictions despite low vaccine intake, has missed a goal to vaccinate 10 million people by September, with little over 5 million inoculated. About 40% of medical and school staff were not vaccinated and officials have so far stopped short of making it mandatory.

The allegation comes two months after the Pegasus Project, a media consortium that included the Guardian, revealed that the phone numbers of top French officials, including French president Emmanuel Macron and most of his 20-strong cabinet, appeared in a leaked database at the heart of the investigative project. There is no firm evidence that the phones of the five cabinet members were successfully hacked, but the Mediapart allegations indicate that the devices were targeted with the powerful spyware known as Pegasus, which is made by NSO Group. When it is successfully deployed by the Israeli company’s government clients, Pegasus allows its users to monitor conversations, text messages, photos and location, and can turn phones into remotely operated listening devices. The Pegasus Project consortium, which was coordinated by the French media non-profit Forbidden Stories, revealed that global clients of NSO had used hacking software to target human rights activists, journalists and lawyers. NSO has said that its powerful spyware is meant to be used to investigate serious crime, and not to target members of civil society. It has said that it has no connection to the leaked database that was investigated by the Pegasus Project and that the tens of thousands of numbers contained in the list are not the targets of NSO’s government clients. It has also staunchly denied that Macron was ever targeted by Pegasus spyware. In a statement released on Thursday night, NSO said: “We stand by our previous statements regarding French government officials. They are not and have never been Pegasus targets. We won’t comment on anonymous source allegations.” Mediapart said the telephones of the ministers for education, territorial cohesion, agriculture, housing and overseas – respectively Jean-Michel Blanquer, Jacqueline Gourault, Julien Denormandie, Emmanuelle Wargon and Sébastien Lecornu – showed traces of the Pegasus malware. It said not all the ministers were in their current posts at the time of the alleged targeting, which occurred in 2019 and, less frequently, in 2020, but all were ministers. The phone of one of Macron’s diplomatic advisers at the Élysée Palace had also been targeted, it said. Forensic analysis of their devices at the end of July had revealed the presence of “suspect traces” of the spyware, according to a report by French state intelligence services and a parallel criminal investigation by the Paris public prosecutor, it said. The alleged victims, approached either directly or through their offices, had either not responded or said they did not wish to comment publicly on such a sensitive subject. Some referred Mediapart to France’s secretariat-general for defence and national security (SGDSN), which also declined comment. The Élysée Palace also said it would not comment on “long and complex investigations which are still ongoing”. At least one of the ministers has since changed both their telephone and phone number, Mediapart said. The prosecutor’s office has declined to comment on the progress of its investigation or to confirm whether or not it had uncovered the hacking of the ministers’ phones, saying the inquiry was governed by rules of judicial secrecy. The Élysée has not commented on the Pegasus scandal since late July, when palace officials advised prudence, saying there was “no certainty at this stage”. Macron is, however, understood to have changed his phone number for some calls. The French defence minister, Florence Parly, met her Israeli counterpart, Benny Gantz, in Paris in July and reportedly discussed the scandal, but no details of their conversation have leaked, Mediapart said. The state secretary for European affairs, Clément Beaune, said in August that the “gravity of the allegations” and the ongoing judicial proceedings meant the government could say little. “We are still untangling the truth of the situation,” he said."

Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and his counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland cited estimates by Public Health England that adding more fluoride to water supplies would reduce cavities by 17% among the richest children and 28% among the poorest. They also dismissed safety concerns saying there is no evidence that ionised form of the element fluorine causes cancer and condemned “exaggerated and unevidenced” suggestions about health risks. Fluoride is found in low levels in water and is known to protect teeth. In an evidence review published on Thursday, the medical officers concluded: “As with all things in medicine and public health there is a balance of risk and benefit. There is unquestionably an issue with tooth decay in the UK and an entrenched inequality which needs to be addressed. Fluoridation of water can reduce this common problem. “On balance, there is strong scientific evidence that water fluoridation is an effective public health intervention for reducing the prevalence of tooth decay and improving dental health equality across the UK. It should be seen as a complementary strategy, not a substitute for other effective methods of increasing fluoride use.” Tooth decay is the biggest cause of hospitalisation for children aged from five to nine. In the 2019 school year, 23.4% of five-year-olds in England and 26.5% of four- to five-year-olds in Scotland had experienced damage to their teeth. Local authorities are now responsible for deciding whether to add fluoride to local water supplies. The health bill going before MPs will give Sajid Javid, the health secretary, the power to order fluoridation across the country. However, any move towards centralisation is not expected soon. Javid tweeted a link to the chief medical officer’s conclusions and wrote: “Good to see UK CMOs examining how water fluoridation can improve oral health & prevent tooth decay which disproportionately affects more deprived groups. Reinforces why our health and care bill will make it simpler to expand water fluoridation schemes.” In England, only 5.8 million people drink water with fluoride, some of which occurs naturally. It is more common in other countries including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Spain, South Korea and New Zealand. The World Health Organization recommends a safe limit of about twice the levels that fluoridation schemes are likely to set. Whitty and his colleagues said that levels must be “closely monitored” by drinking water inspectors. The British Dental Association (BDA) welcomed the statement from the four UK chief medical officers. Eddie Crouch, the BDA chair, said: “Every dentist will thank the CMOs for recognising the lasting benefits water fluoridation could bring to the nation’s oral health. “However, these gains are purely theoretical without upfront investment. Spending here will pay for itself, and ministers need to show they are willing to seize the moment. We need a joined-up approach. Covid has left millions unable to access care, and deep inequalities are now set to widen.” The Oral Health Foundation said it fully supports the statement from the UK chief medical officers on the effectiveness of fluoridated water and how beneficial it can be in reducing tooth decay. The argument over whether the mineral should be added to water supplies has been long running. In 2014, Public Health England urged councils in England to add fluoride to improve dental health. In Australia, dentists and doctors in Queensland reported “extensive tooth decay” in 2019 in parts of the state that refuse to add fluoride to the water supply, especially among children and elderly people. Indigenous children, many of whom live in communities without fluoride, had a 70% rate of tooth decay. The rate was 55% among all Queensland children aged between five and 15. In 2016, Australia’s chief health and medical research agency said adding the mineral to drinking water does not lower a person’s IQ, cause cancer or cause any other negative health effects after analysing more than 3,000 studies."

The quake's epicentre was near the rural town of Mansfield, about 200 km northeast of Melbourne, and was at a depth of 10 km. An aftershock was rated 4.0. Images and video footage circulating on social media showed rubble blocking one of Melbourne’s main streets, while people in northern parts of the city said on social media they had lost power and others said they were evacuated from buildings. The quake was felt as far away as city of Adelaide, 800 km to the west in the state of South Australia, and Sydney, 900 km to the north in New South Wales state, although there were no reports of damage outside Melbourne and no reports of injuries. More than half Australia’s 25 million population lives in the southeast of the country from Adelaide to Melbourne to Sydney. “We have had no reports of serious injuries, or worse, and that is very good news and we hope that good news will continue,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Washington. “It can be a very disturbing event, an earthquake of this nature. They are very rare events in Australia and as a result, I am sure people would have been quite distressed and disturbed.” Quakes are relatively unusual in Australia’s populated east due to its position in the middle of the Indo-Australian Tectonic Plate, according to Geoscience Australia. The quake on Wednesday measured higher than the country’s deadliest tremor, a 5.6 in Newcastle in 1989, which resulted in 13 deaths. The mayor of Mansfield, Mark Holcombe, said he was in his home office on his farm when the quake struck and ran outside for safety. “I have been in earthquakes overseas before and it seemed to go on longer than I have experienced before,” Holcombe told the ABC. “The other thing that surprised me was how noisy it was. It was a real rumbling like a big truck going past.” He said he knew of no serious damage near the quake epicentre, although some residents reported problems with telecommunications. No tsunami threat has been issued to the Australian mainland, islands or territories, the country's Bureau of Meteorology said in a statement. The quake presented a potential disruption for anti-lockdown protests expected in Melbourne on Wednesday, which would be the third day of unrest that has reached increasing levels of violence and police response."

(AP Photo/Joseph Odelyn) PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Dozens of migrants upset about being deported to Haiti from the U.S. clashed with authorities while trying to rush back into a plane that landed Tuesday afternoon in Port-au-Prince. A security guard closed the plane door just in time as some deportees began throwing shoes at the plane, yelling, “This is abuse!” and “How is this possible?!” The group that included men and women had disembarked from the second of four flights that arrived on Tuesday, with some temporarily losing their belongings in the scuffle as police arrived. Among those trying to get back on the plane was Maxine Orélien, who blamed Haiti’s prime minister for the situation. “What can we provide for our family?” he said. “We can’t do anything for our family here. There is nothing in this country.” Orélien is among the hundreds of migrants whom the U.S. began deporting to Haiti starting Sunday, with several more flights scheduled in upcoming days. Many of them left their country after the devastating 2010 earthquake and now worry about how they will find jobs and housing and provide for their families in a country of more than 11 million people where about 60% earn less than $2 a day. ADVERTISEMENT Haiti also is struggling to recover from the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti’s southern region in mid-August, killing more than 2,200 people and destroying or damaging tens of thousands of homes. Those deported with young children are especially worried about the recent spike in violence in Port-au-Prince, with gangs controlling roughly one-third of the capital. Kidnappings have become increasingly common, with targets ranging from young schoolchildren to nuns to impoverished families. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, said in a statement Tuesday that it was outraged by what it called the U.S. government’s inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants and asylum seekers. It also called for an immediate halt to all Haiti-bound flights. “During a challenging and dangerous period for Haiti, it is unthinkably cruel to send men, women and children back to what many of them do not even call ‘home’ anymore,” the group said. Haiti’s ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection also said it was concerned about the fate of the migrants, especially women and children, and asked for a moratorium on flights as it criticized Haitian leaders for the state of the country. “One of the causes of this situation, considered a tragedy, remains the bad governance that has gripped the country for several decades,” it said. “And today, we are witnessing a deterioration in living conditions due to the irresponsibility of the current authorities in the protection and implementation of economic, social and cultural rights.” Meanwhile, the future of thousands of migrants who remain along the Mexico-Texas border is in limbo. U.S. expulsion flights are expected to continue while Mexico was flying and busing some of the migrants away from the border. So far, more than 6,000 Haitians and other migrants had been removed from an encampment at Del Rio, Texas. The rapid expulsions were made possible by a pandemic-related authority adopted by former U.S. President Donald Trump in March 2020 that allows for migrants to be immediately removed from the country without an opportunity to seek asylum. U.S. President Joe Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the order but let the rest stand. ___ AP writer Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico contributed to this report."

The concern is, the inflators can explode and, in rare instances, send deadly metal fragments flying, with deadly consequences. The worldwide Takata recalls taken together were already the largest safety recall in automotive history, involving more than 67 million Takata airbag inflators recalled in the United States and more than 100 million worldwide. Millions of those vehicles are still driving around with potentially dangerous airbags. The defective inflators have killed at least 28 people worldwide, including 19 in the United States, and have caused more than 400 injuries. In the U.S., 16 of those deaths were in Honda vehicles, two in Fords and one in a BMW. Overseas, 9 other Honda deaths occurred in Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico. NHTSA on Tuesday said the additional 30 million vehicles were manufactured by two dozen automakers between 2001 and 2019 — and comprise 1,384 different vehicle models in all. They include vehicles from Honda, Ford, Toyota, General Motors, Nissan, Subaru, Tesla, Ferrari, Mazda, Daimler, BMW, Chrysler, Porsche, Jaguar, Land Rover and others. The new investigation is an engineering analysis — meaning that this new round of vehicles is not yet part of the greater recall. NHTSA said that ""while no present safety risk has been identified, further work is needed to evaluate the future risk of non-recalled"" inflators. The agency ""is not aware at this time of any ruptures, injuries or fatalities due to propellant degradation in these inflators, and the driving public does not need to take any action."" The inflators in the new investigation contain a desiccant, or drying agent, that is supposed to keep moisture from degrading the circuitry. In the previous Takata recalls, propellant that was designed to inflate the airbag in an accident could break down after long-term exposure to large fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Those airbags did not contain a drying agent. The airbags now under investigation do. Story continues Honda said automakers ""have been working collaboratively with NHTSA to assure the safety of these inflators for several years. ... Honda is committed to quickly informing NHTSA and other stakeholders if this ongoing analysis shows any risk of rupture."" The Japanese automaker vowed to take quick action ""if Honda believes that there is a threat to the safety of our customers."""

Demonstrators claim recent rent hikes coupled with limited dormitory capacity are putting pressure on students as well as renters in urban areas across the country. The protests materialized with student-led camping events in Istanbul last week and have since expanded to multiple cities, including Izmir, Kocaeli and Ankara, where police detained nine protesters Monday night. The developments highlight soaring rent prices in Turkey, where apartment rates grew an average of 55% over the last year and consumers continue to face high inflation that has increased their cost of living. This month protest organizers launched a Movement of the Unsheltered platform on social media, through which they are prompting citizens impacted by high housing costs to fill out a form and take part in initiatives aiming to spur legislative action that would bring down exorbitant rent prices. “Rents around universities are very expensive because it is thought that a few students will move in together,” Ebru Sert, a representative for the Movement of the Unsheltered and student at Istanbul’s Yildiz Technical University, told Al-Monitor. “Students have faced a 40% rise [in rents] in some regions and a 300% rise in other regions in the last year.” Among those planning to camp out in Istanbul Tuesday evening was Olcay Atik, 22, a student activist at Bogazici University currently studying chemistry. Atik said he was joining the protest after he was unable to find an affordable rental near his school last month. “Almost all of the apartments we went to were in terrible, horrible condition and almost all of them were being rented at ridiculous rates,” Atik told Al-Monitor. He said many landlords were not able to collect full rents on their properties during the pandemic, at times being lenient to accommodate unemployed or underemployed tenants. Yet as the fall semester approaches, Atik said some landlords may be looking to make up for lost rent payments over the last year and a half and have upped their rates. “Their goal is to compensate for [the pandemic] by charging university students ridiculous amounts of money because they can get away with it,” Atik told Al-Monitor. “A large part of the population is struggling with this.” Housing and economic challenges have affected far more than students in Turkey, where annual inflation rose to 19.25% in August, the highest level in two years, and construction costs grew 44.76% year-on-year in July, according to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute. With the national minimum wage at 3,578 Turkish liras ($413) per month, rising housing costs have rendered just 2% of rental properties in Istanbul “affordable,” according to a recent report by Turkey’s Center for Spatial Justice. In response to rising costs, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his government would work to control price increases on both food and rental units. “We are well aware of problems about the cost of living caused by inflation,” Erdogan said in Kirsehir. “We will prevent excessive price increases on the shelves by placing the inflation under control as soon as possible through lowering costs and fighting opportunists.” According to the pro-government Sabah newspaper, Turkish lawmakers are currently looking to alleviate affordable housing shortages by creating programs that would see construction companies develop residential buildings as dedicated rental units. Meanwhile, some opposition lawmakers are highlighting an apparent shortage of student dormitories in Turkey. Muazzez Orhan-Isik, a deputy with the People's Democratic Party, said Monday there were 8 million university students in Turkey, while dormitory units available through the state’s Loans and Dormitories Institution totaled less than 800,000. The shortage is causing some students to drop out of school, Orhan-Isik said.

Bukele is a heavy Twitter user, and after his description changed to “dictator,” he continued tweeting normally Monday about bitcoin. The price and potential of the cryptocurrency appears to fascinate Bukele, and he made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, the first country to do so. Not everyone was charmed by the tactic. “Changing his Twitter profile to call himself the dictator of El Salvador is a very childish act on the part of the president,"" said legislator Johnny Wright Sol, a member of the opposition Nuestro Tiempo party. “This is part of the president's strategy,"" said lawyer Eduardo Escobar, of Citizen's Action, a civic group devoted to government accountability. “He is trying to ridicule the feelings of the public or the opposition.” Last week, thousands of people gathered in El Salvador’s capital for the first mass march against Bukele, who protesters say has concentrated too much power, weakened the independence of the courts and may seek re-election. Bukele, known for his wry style, dismissed the Sept. 15 demonstration by saying protesters “took to the streets to fight a dictatorship that doesn't exist.” The populist president elected in 2019 has maintained high popularity with his vows to stamp out corruption that was rampant among the country’s traditional parties. But some Salvadorans say he is becoming a dictator for real. Bukele’s New Ideas party won a congressional majority this year and immediately after taking its seats in the National Assembly in May, it replaced the five members of the Constitutional Chamber and the independent attorney general who had balked at several of Bukele’s earlier actions. Soon after, the Constitutional Chamber tossed aside what had long been interpreted as a constitutional ban on consecutive presidential reelection, setting the stage for Bukele to potentially seek a second term in 2024. Bukele has not so far announced plans to seek reelection, but critics assume he will. Some marchers last week protested the controversial decision by Bukele’s government to roll out a digital bitcoin wallet known as the “Chivo” one week ago. The system has been down frequently for maintenance. Some marchers wore T-shirts that read “NO To Bitcoin.” A few demonstrators vandalized the special ATM machines set up to handle bitcoin transactions, but which have been inoperable anyway much of the time. The cubicle housing one ATM machine was destroyed. The digital wallet appears to have been overloaded by the sheer number of Salvadorans looking to take advantage of the $30 bonus that the government put in each account to incentivize adoption. Bukele, the main promotor of using the cryptocurrency, acknowledged the government’s three-month rollout may have been too ambitious. He said technical glitches had prevented the app from working on some kinds of phones. Any business with the technological capacity to do so is required to accept payment in bitcoin, but no private citizen is required to use it. Recent public opinion surveys in El Salvador have said a majority of Salvadorans oppose making the bitcoin an official currency. Still Bukele says there are now 1.6 million users of the digital payment system in the Central American nation."

It's a first, per the report, with billionaires around the world increasing their collective wealth by 5.7%. Wealth taxes have been floated as one way to redistribute wealth and address pandemic inequity. See more stories on Insider's business page. The pandemic was a boon for billionaires. It grew their collective wealth and helped more people join their ranks. For the first time, the world has more than 3,000 billionaires, according to a new report from research firm Wealth-X. That's a 13.4% increase since 2019. Their total wealth swelled to $10 trillion - a 5.7% increase in net worth. ""Viewed in aggregate, the global pandemic delivered a windfall to billionaire wealth, boosted by the flood of monetary stimulus and swelling profits in key sectors that coined a new wave of younger, self-made billionaires,"" the report said. But not all billionaire wealth was created equal, with those who find their fortunes in pandemic-stricken industries like travel and entertainment not benefiting as much as those in sectors like technology. Even so, the uneven wealth gains came as workers around the world lost $3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic, according to a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO). In the US alone, poverty ticked up by 1% from 2019 to 2020, according to the US Census Bureau, and median household income dropped by 2.9%. North America cemented its status as ""the world's leading billionaire region in 2020,"" with the three-comma club there growing by 17.5% from the year prior. In fact, North America's 980 billionaires account for 30.6% of the world's billionaires. The US was the top billionaire country in 2020. When it came to growing the ranks of billionaires, Asia followed close behind North America, with the number of billionaires growing by 16.5%, for a grand total of of 883. Asia's billionaires saw their collective net worths growth to $2.6 trillion - a 7.5% increase. Those gains come amid growing calls to tax the rich and address inequality The report attributes the ongoing and ever-growing wealth divide as one contributing factor in increasing unrest across the world. ""As the global economy gradually emerges from the crisis, the issue of widening inequality may well spur more concerted redistributive policy efforts in areas such as tax and regulation,"" the report said. One prominent critic of the monumental wealth gains by billionaires has emerged: President Joe Biden. ""Billionaires have seen their wealth go up by $1.8 trillion,"" Biden said in a recent speech, referencing a report from the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies tracking gains by American billionaires (their net worths leapt by 62% during the pandemic, according to the report). Biden said: ""It's simply not fair."" A wealth tax has consistently been floated as one way to address pandemic inequity and bolster economies. The International Monetary Fund has said a temporary tax on the wealthy could help aid pandemic recovery; Argentina went a step further and instituted a one-off hike on its wealthiest residents, raising $2.4 billion. A report from Oxfam, the Fight Inequality Alliance, and the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies and Patriotic Millionaires found that a one-time 99% wealth tax on the world's billionaires could raise more than enough to vaccinate the world. In the US, House Democrats have proposed a new tax plan that would unwind some Trump-era tax cuts and hike rates on large corporations, assets like stocks, and Americans earning over $5 million. However, the 3% ""surtax"" on Americans who earn over $5 million still falls short of an outright wealth tax, Insider's Ben Winck and Ayelet Sheffey report - a measure that's overwhelmingly popular."

Researchers measured the impacts on the habitats of 14,000 species of plants and animals, finding that 93 to 95% suffered some consequence of the fires. Primates were the most affected, as they depend on trees for movement, food and shelter. Rare and endemic species with restricted habitats suffered the strongest impacts. The study assessed two decades of fires between 2001 and 2019 and confirmed the impact of environmental policies on deforestation cycles in the Amazon; law enforcement was concluded to have direct impact on the extent and volume of fires. Since 2019, deforestation and fires have caused the Brazilian Amazon to lose about 10,000 square kilometers of forest cover per year – a high and alarming increase over the previous decade, when the annual reduction in forest area was close to 6,500 square kilometers, according to data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE). However, until very recently, experts had measured only the vegetation in areas destroyed; never had the biodiversity loss caused by fires been assessed. A new scientific study published in Nature – “How deregulation, drought and increasing fire impact Amazonian biodiversity” – translates this impact into numbers: to a greater or lesser extent, 93 to 95% of 14,000 species of plants and animals have already suffered some kind of consequence of the Amazon’s fires. The study, which involved researchers from universities and institutions in the U.S., Brazil and the Netherlands, analyzed data on the distribution of fires in the Amazon between 2001 and 2019, when the region saw record rates of major fires, despite high rainfall. “At the time, the fires attracted a lot of international media attention, and we were interested in better understanding their consequences, where they had happened, and which areas were occupied by fauna and flora,” says biologist Mathias Pires, a professor and researcher at the Department of Animal Biology at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp). Using satellite images, the researchers compared the areas affected by fires – from 103,079 to 189,755 square kilometers of the Amazon rainforest – with habitats of 11,514 plant species and 3,079 animals (including vertebrates, birds and mammals). “We were surprised to find that the habitats of most plant and animal species had already been affected by fires and that this impact continued to increase over time, despite the best conservation efforts,” says Brian Enquist, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona and a lead author of the article. Primates suffered the worst impacts The analysis indicated that, for some species, more than 60% of their habitat had been burned at some point in the last two decades. For the majority of the Amazonian plants and animals, though, the impacted areas represent least than 10% of their habitar range. While this sounds like a small percentage, a little bit of habitat loss in the Amazon can already be consequential for species survival. “Any lost habitat is already too much,” says Danilo Neves, professor of ecology at the Institute of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). He explains that some groups of rare and threatened species have restricted distribution in the Amazon, such as the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), which is endemic to Brazil and classified as endangered on the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), meaning that its probability of extinction is high. “That species depends a lot on the standing forest,” says Pires. “Monkeys need trees for displacement, food and shelter. They hardly ever move or feed on the ground.” The white-cheeked spider monkey had 5% of its range affected by fire. “Five percent of the range impacted in 20 years is a lot,” he says. “What will happen in another 20 years, or 50…? We need to consider that, from a biological point of view, that’s very fast loss of habitat.” Pires stresses that primates are under the highest threat from Amazonian fires. To draw a parallel with another animal species, he uses a bird – the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin). Classified as threatened on the IUCN list, it ends up being relatively less affected by forest fires since its habitat range can cover virtually the entire Amazon. As for plants, which, unlike animals, cannot escape the flames, the situation is even more disturbing. The tree species Allantoma kuhlmannii had about 35% of its range impacted by fire. Unlike the Cerrado, where plants are more resistant to fire and drought, Amazon vegetation is adapted to closed environments and moist soil; when the flames end, the plants can hardly recover, and that part of their habitat may be lost forever. Since the study focused on measuring the number of species impacted by fire, it did not look for any visible change in animals’ behavior or habitat. “Given the scale, scope and growing impact of fires across the Amazon, it’s likely that animal populations have already been affected by habitat loss and the opening of more remote areas to hunting,” Enquist believes. Less enforcement, more fires By overlaying data on fires with the habitat ranges of flora and fauna, the researchers noticed three fire cycles in the Amazon, which are directly associated with distinct political contexts in Brazil. In 2001 to 2008, lack of strict environmental enforcement in the country served as fuel for more frequent fires in larger areas. In the following period, 2009 to 2018, enforcement policies managed to curb deforestation. However, in 2016, even though Brazil’s environment protection laws were praised globally, enforcement loosened, and deforestation started to rise again in the Amazon. In 2019, when current president Jair Bolsonaro took office, the situation worsened. High forest destruction rates continued, driven by federal government rhetoric in favor of mining, against demarcation of indigenous lands, and critical of the work of non-governmental organizations. “Our results clearly show that forest protection policies had a dramatic effect on the rate of impact of fires and on Amazonian biodiversity,” stresses Enquist. The international survey points out that, in recent years, there have been fires in more central parts of the Amazon, including areas close to rivers, which is a new trend. “Fire consolidates deforestation. Deforested areas can regenerate, but that would require much more time and investment after the fires,” says Neves. Risk of biodiversity loss and more extinctions Scientists worldwide have made clear what needs to be done to restore the Amazon, that being to reduce deforestation, prevent fires and, consequently, protect the habitats of millions of plant and animal species. The formula to do so exists and has been used in the past: stronger commitment to environmentalism, effective law enforcement, forest monitoring, and support for environmental agencies. Brazilian researchers Danilo Neves and Mathias Pires have no doubt that this is the only way to reverse the current scenario of habitat devastation and loss. “We know what to do. We have already solved the problem before,” says Pires. The evidence is indisputable. Forest protection policies have a dramatic effect on fires and their impact on Amazonian biodiversity. But, if nothing is done, what can we expect from the future of life in this biome? “We risk reducing and potentially losing large fractions of biodiversity, which is nature’s capital that gives resilience to climate change, and important ecosystem services that the Amazon provides to humanity,” says Enquist. “If nothing changes, we will see continued habitat degradation for most Amazonian species. As fire and deforestation now move into the heart of the Amazon and regions that are home to species inhabiting smaller geographic areas, the risk of extinction increases dramatically for thousands of forms of life.” This story was produced in collaboration with Landscape News to raise awareness of topics relevant to the upcoming Global Landscapes Forum’s Amazonia Digital Conference: The Tipping Point (September 21-23, 2021).

The EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton — an appointee of the French government under President Emmanuel Macron — made the comment during a visit to Washington where he met with U.S. counterparts to discuss coronavirus policies, technology and cybersecurity issues. ""I planned this visit to the U.S. weeks ago with a positive agenda, to deepen EU-U.S. cooperation [but] something has changed,"" Breton is expected to say at a virtual event, according to prepared notes shared with reporters. ""There is a growing feeling in Europe – and I say this with regret – that something is broken in our transatlantic relations."" ""There is a strong perception that trust between the EU and U.S. has been eroded,"" Breton will say, singling out the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and last week's security cooperation agreement between Washington, London and Canberra as key reasons. ""It is probably time to pause and reset our EU-U.S. relationship."" Breton's remarks come after other EU leaders on Monday accused U.S. President Joe Biden of disloyalty and demanded he explain why he misled France and other European partners in forging a new strategic tie-up with the U.K. and Australia. The so-called AUSUK deal meant that Canberra canceled a deal worth more than €50 billion to buy French submarines. The United States tried to ease European concerns on Monday when it announced a sudden decision to lift coronavirus travel restrictions for fully-vaccinated Europeans looking to fly to the U.S. from November onward. The decision to lift restrictions is ""a welcome – but logical – decision given the success of the vaccination campaign in the EU,"" Breton will say. European diplomats are currently deliberating whether to cancel or postpone an upcoming EU-U.S. summit to discuss joint policies on technology and trade. The first meeting of the Trade and Tech Council is scheduled for September 29, in Pittsburgh, but the diplomatic crisis means the EU could cancel the gathering altogether, officials told POLITICO."

""They were preparing the conclave (to elect a new pope). So be it. Thank God, I am well."" Francis, who was elected pontiff in 2013, underwent colon surgery on July 4, and spent 11 days in hospital. He has since resumed a full work schedule. Addressing some of the challenges facing the Church, Francis took aim at traditionalists, saying that ""turning back is not the right way"" and that it was important to move forward. He denounced a ""major Catholic television station"", which he did not name, that he said was constantly attacking him. ""I personally may deserve attacks and insults because I am a sinner, but the Church does not deserve this. It is the work of the devil,"" he said. In recent years, Francis has been the focus of criticism from a small but powerful number of American conservatives unhappy with his stands on various theological issues as well as social matters from immigration to climate change. They are regularly given time on the U.S.-based Catholic television network EWTN. The pope admitted that criticism from clerics within the Church annoyed him at times. ""I sometimes lose patience, especially when they make judgments without entering into a real dialogue. I can't do anything there. However, I go on without entering their world of ideas and fantasies,"" he said. He warned against clerical ""rigidity"" and said God wanted society to be free. The Catholic Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are, but Francis has been more conciliatory towards gay people than perhaps any other pope. ""We are afraid to accompany people with sexual diversity,"" he was quoted as saying by the magazine, adding that priests should offer support to homosexual couples. However, he cautioned against the rise of ""gender ideology"". ""It is dangerous because it is abstract with respect to the concrete life of a person, as if a person can decide abstractly at will whether and when to be a man or a woman,"" he said.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry had made coal the central topic of his meetings with officials in China earlier this month. In a statement on Tuesday, Kerry welcomed the move. “We’ve been talking to China for quite some period of time about this. And I’m absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision,"" Kerry said. ""It’s a great contribution. It’s a good beginning to the efforts we need to achieve success in Glasgow.” ""This is the announcement China could deliver right now and the one that the U.S. wanted. Investment already trending in this direction,"" Joanna Lewis, an associate professor at Georgetown University and an expert on Chinese climate policy, said in a tweet. The policy change could help bring momentum to the global climate talks this November in Glasgow, Scotland, since nations had been pressing China to reduce both its world-leading domestic emissions and its support for carbon dioxide-intensive industries abroad. ""China was the last government still financing overseas coal plants, so this should eliminate the overseas coal pipeline that was poised to lead us over the climate cliff,"" said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Context: Nixing coal finance could halt 40 gigawatts-worth of coal-fired projects currently in the pre-construction phase that have received public Chinese finance, according to think tank E3G. More than 70 percent of global coal-fired power plants rely on Chinese funding, according to the Beijing-based Green Belt and Road Initiative. Public Chinese finance has put more than 53 gigawatts of coal power online across the world, more than double Japan's 21 gigawatts, according to EndCoal.org, a project of several environmental groups. Rumors swirled for months that China already told its state lending institutions that it was ending coal finance, said Justin Guay, director of global climate strategy with climate group the Sunrise Project, calling it ""an open secret."" ""The details have not been announced, and the devil is always in the details — so there’s a lot we don't know,"" Guay said. ""That being said, China doesn't do things half-cocked.” Still, China has continued building domestic coal-fired power plants. Xi reiterated China's goal to peak emissions sooner than 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, though nations like the U.S. have pushed him to accelerate those targets. "

Paris has recalled its ambassadors from Canberra and Washington, saying it was blindsided by Canberra's decision to build nuclear-powered submarines with the United States and Britain rather than stick with its contract for French diesel submarines. read more Yet as early as September 2018, an independent oversight board led by a former U.S. Secretary of the Navy Donald Winter had advised Australia to look at alternatives, and questioned whether the project was in the national interest, a 2020 public report from the country's Auditor-General shows. Australian parliamentary hearings and reports on the project, first priced at $40 billion and more recently at $60 billion, even before construction had begun, also showed problems emerging. In June the defence secretary told parliament ""contingency planning"" for the programme was under way. ""They would have to have their eyes shut not to realise the danger they were facing,"" said Rex Patrick, an independent senator for South Australia, referring to France. Government ministers said this week Canberra had been ""up front"" with Paris about the problems. A French lawmaker also raised questions in parliament in June about Australian concerns over delays, and whether Australia might be considering submarine alternatives, French parliamentary records show. ""We chose not to go through a gate in a contract,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters when he arrived in New York on Monday. ""The contract was set up that way, and we chose not to go through it because we believed to do so would ultimately not be in Australia's interests."" French officials deny that the contract had been plagued with problems for years, saying that at each stage difficulties had been resolved and that they had expected that the contract for the detailed design phase would be signed in September. France's Armed Forces Ministry spokesman Herve Grandjean made that point clear on Tuesday. ""On the same day as the #AUKUS announcement, the Australians wrote to France to say that they were satisfied with the submarine's achievable performance and with the progress of the program. In short: forward to launching the next phase of the contract,"" he said on Twitter. The Australian and French defence and foreign ministers had ""underlined the importance"" of the deal, according to a joint statement on Aug. 30. French officials have not disputed that there were difficulties, like with any big contract, but say there was 18 months of ""subterfuge"" and ""trickery"" by Australian authorities who concealed the rival deal with Britain and the United States. They said that at no point did Canberra suggest to Paris to offer an alternative programme with nuclear propulsion despite French officials bringing the subject over the past few months. An official from the French Embassy in Canberra said an intergovernmental agreement should have allowed for confidential discussions between ministers about changes to political or strategic circumstances. ""No warning, no proposals for discussion were offered,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

The Australian government has considered extending the life of the Collins class as it examines the fate of its next-generation sub program./File Photo The deal was first announced in 2016. A pre-design review was delayed in 2018 because the ""work provided to Defence by Naval Group did not meet Defence's requirements"", the Australian audit said, citing lack of design detail, operational requirements and 63 studies not completed. The contract between Australia and Naval Group, majority owned by the French government, was signed 16 months late in February 2019. It included contractual off-ramps in which Australia could pay to exit the project, and established ""control gates"" whereby Naval Group must meet criteria before progressing to the next phase. The defence department considered these ""hold points"" for assessing the project's risk, the Auditor-General said. In September 2019, with A$446 million ($325 million) already spent in France, the defence department told the auditor it had examined extending the life of Australia's Collins-class submarine fleet ""and the time this would allow to develop a new acquisition strategy"". The 2020 Auditor-General's report examining the submarine deal - the Department of Defence's biggest ever - found the department had been ""frank and timely"" in communicating concerns with Naval Group. Naval Group said in a statement to Reuters that it was aware of public discussion, but that official declarations were supportive of the submarine programme. It said Morrison was ""very clear that the decision was not a result of difficulties with the Future Submarine Program or Naval Group"". ""Naval Group delivered on its commitments to the Commonwealth of Australia as acknowledged by the letter for termination 'for convenience' we received,"" the statement said. REVIEW PANEL According to the Auditor-General's report, the most recent major milestone in the French contract - a preliminary design review - was in January 2021. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Naval Group Australia provided material to Defence in ""late January or February"", but that Australia did not consider it to meet requirements. Morrison's office created a panel in January to advise an inner circle of his Cabinet on how to proceed with the programme, contract notices and parliament records show. In June, senators, including Patrick, asked panel chairman William Hilarides, a former vice admiral in the U.S. Navy, if it had advised the government to cancel the French contract. Hilarides, who had overseen ship and submarine construction for the U.S. Navy, said the panel's advice was confidential. The former head of BAE Systems Submarines, Murray Easton, who had turned around a delayed British nuclear submarine programme, joined the panel in February, contract notices show. It met by videoconference 10 times by June, including confidential briefings for its U.S. members at the Australian embassy in Washington, the parliament was told. Easton and Hilarides did not respond to requests for comment.

A string of explosions struck Taliban vehicles in Afghanistan's provincial city of Jalalabad over the weekend, killing eight people, among them Taliban fighters. On Monday, three more explosions were heard in the city, an IS stronghold, with unconfirmed reports of additional Taliban casualties. The Taliban are under pressure to contain IS militants, in part to make good on a promise to the international community that they will prevent the staging of terror attacks from Afghan soil. There is also a widely held expectation among conflict-weary Afghans that, despite fears and misgivings about the Taliban, the new rulers will at least restore a measure of public safety. ""We thought that since the Taliban have come, peace will come,"" said Feda Mohammad, a brother of an 18-year-old rickshaw driver who was killed in one of Sunday's blasts, along with a 10-year-old cousin. ""But there's no peace, no security. You can't hear anything except the news of bomb blasts killing this one or that,"" Mohammad said, speaking at the family home where relatives and neighbours gathered for a memorial ceremony, drinking black tea and reciting verses from the Quran. The latest IS bombings come as the Taliban face the daunting task of governing a country shredded by four decades of war. The economy is in free fall, the health system on the verge of collapse and thousands of members of the country's educated elite have fled. International aid groups predict worsening drought, hunger and poverty. ""Our misery has reached its peak,"" Abdullah, a shopkeeper in Jalalabad, said Monday, a day after IS claimed responsibility for the bombings that rocked the city the two days before. ""People have no jobs, people sell their carpets to buy flour still there are explosions and (IS) claims the attacks,"" said Abdullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name. The weekend bomb blasts served as a reminder of the threat the militants pose. Just weeks ago, as American and foreign troops completed their withdrawal and frantic airlift from the country, IS suicide bombers targeted US evacuation efforts outside Kabul international airport in one of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan in years. The blast killed 169 Afghans and 13 US service members. The events have bolstered fears of more violence, as IS militants exploit the vulnerability of an overstretched Taliban government facing massive security challenges and an economic meltdown. ""They're making a very dramatic comeback,"" Ibraheem Bahiss, an International Crisis Group consultant and an independent research analyst said of Islamic State. ""There could be a long-term struggle between the groups."" For now, the Afghan affiliate of IS has shied away from attacks against the West and maintained a local focus, but that could potentially change, Bahiss said. The aims of the IS affiliate in Afghanistan are different from those of the Taliban, who seized control of the country days before the US troop pullout last month. While the Taliban have fought to gain ground in Afghanistan, the IS chapter seeks to incorporate swaths of the country into a broader self-styled caliphate, or Islamic empire, across the Middle East. The franchise, largely made up of Pakistani militants pushed across the border by military operations, first embraced the IS call for a worldwide jihad against non-Muslims in the months after the group's core fighters swept through Syria and Iraq in the summer of 2014. While they share enmity toward American forces and a harsh interpretation of Sunni Islam, the Taliban and IS are sworn enemies. Just as the Taliban battled US coalition troops in the long Afghan war, the group also waged a successful offensive to drive IS militants from their enclaves in the country's north and east, at times assisted by the US and US-backed Afghan government. Despite years of US airstrikes and other military setbacks that shrank IS ranks, the United Nations reported this year the group ""remains active and dangerous,"" a threat to Afghanistan and the wider region. The affiliate has mounted some of the country's most brutal attacks in recent years on schools, mosques and even a maternity hospital, mainly targeting the Shiite Muslim minority. The affiliate has increasingly drawn hard-line Taliban defectors and foreign militants disillusioned with what they see as the Taliban's overly moderate ways. The New York-based Soufan Centre said in an analysis on Monday that the franchise poses ""one of the most serious risks to future splintering of the Taliban at a time when the group is seeking to gather strength and play a major spoiler role in Afghanistan."" As a power struggle between pragmatists and ideologues in the Taliban leadership intensifies, the IS branch has ramped up recruiting efforts. For now, Taliban forces far outnumber IS militants and experts doubt the extremist group poses an existential threat to Afghanistan's new rulers. But if the bombings continue, said Franz Marty, a Kabul-based fellow at the Swiss Institute for Global Affairs, ""it could become a large problem."" ""It's impacting people's perceptions. If the Taliban can't make good on their promise on securing the country, that could turn the tide of public sentiment against them in the east,"" he said. Despite the residents' concerns in Jalalabad, there had been a marked improvement in pubic safety elsewhere, including the capital of Kabul. Before the Taliban takeover, Kabul had been plagued by a sharp increase in crime, and many residents feared to leave their homes after dark. But in Jalalabad, the grief-stricken father of the 10-year-old boy killed in Sunday's blast described the recent attacks as an ominous portent. ""We live in poverty and we don't have security, either,"" said Zarif Khan. ""Today, my son lost his life, tomorrow others' sons will lose their lives."""

Two Indians were arrested after the heroin, which was kept in two containers marked as carrying talc, was found by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) at Mundra Port in the western state of Gujarat, the government agency said. The consignment – with one container carrying nearly 2,000kg of heroin and another holding nearly 1,000kg – originated from Afghanistan and was shipped from a port in Iran to Gujarat, the DRI said. “Searches have been conducted in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Chennai, Gandhidham and Mandvi in Gujarat,” the agency said in a statement. It added that the shipment was estimated to be worth 200bn rupees ($2.7bn). The investigation also allegedly uncovered the involvement of Afghan nationals, the DRI said, although no one else has been arrested so far. Afghanistan is the world’s biggest producer of heroin, supplying between 80-90% of global output. Heroin production has boomed in Afghanistan in recent years, helping fund the Taliban which returned to power in August. Efforts by the US and international community to control the country’s heroin trade over many years have been largely unsuccessful. At the same time, the Taliban’s return to power has placed more strain on the country’s already dire economic situation. The economy was hugely reliant international donors that had a stake in the previous government. Foreign aid and development assistance made up more than 42% of the Afghanistan’s GDP last year, and funded three-quarters of public expenditure. But many of those donors are unwilling to offer support to the Taliban, making the economic outlook even more uncertain. With Agence France-Presse"

Prosecutors believe there is sufficient evidence to charge Denis Sergeev, who went by the alias “Sergey Fedotov,” with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, possessing and using a chemical weapon, and causing grievous bodily harm, according to London's Metropolitan Police force. Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack in March 2018 in the English city of Salisbury. British authorities say the poisoning had almost certainly been approved “at a senior level of the Russian state."" Moscow has vehemently denied the allegations. The Skripals survived, but the attack later claimed the life of a British woman and left a man and a police officer seriously ill. Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 91 Images Political Cartoons View All 230 Images Police previously charged two other Russian military intelligence agents, known by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, saying they traveled to the U.K. for the poisoning operation then flew back to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed the suspects were civilians, and the two suspects appeared on Russian television claiming they had visited Salisbury as tourists. Police said Tuesday they have evidence that the third suspect, Sergeev, was also a member of the Russian military intelligence service known as the GRU. Arrest warrants have been issued for all three men. Police said they will apply for Interpol notices for Sergeev on Tuesday, but British prosecutors said they will not apply to Russia for his extradition because the Russian constitution does not permit extradition of its own nationals. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged that “any formal extradition request is futile"" while the suspects remain in Russia. “Should any of these individuals ever travel outside Russia, we will work with our international partners and take every possible step to detain and extradite them to face justice,"" Home Secretary Priti Patel told Parliament members Tuesday. Skripal, a Russian military intelligence officer turned double agent for Britain, and his daughter, who was visiting him in England, spent weeks in critical condition after the attack. Three months after the pair fell sick, two local residents who apparently picked up a discarded perfume vial that contained the nerve agent fell ill. One recovered, but the other died. A police officer who was investigating the case also fell ill; he recovered but later quit the force. The case ignited a diplomatic confrontation in which hundreds of envoys were expelled by both Russia and Western nations. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Britain continued to use the Skripal case to “fuel anti-Russian sentiment in British society.” “We strongly condemn all attempts by London to hold Moscow responsible for what happened in Salisbury and insist on a professional, objective and impartial investigation of the incident,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters. Zakharova said Russia was prepared to cooperate with British law enforcement but London rejected the idea of a joint investigation. A senior British counter-terrorism officer who has been leading the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, said investigators have pieced together evidence suggesting that all three suspects “previously worked with each other and on behalf of the Russian state as part of operations carried out outside of Russia."" “All three of them are dangerous individuals,” he said. “They have tried to murder people here in the U.K, and they have also brought an extremely dangerous chemical weapon into the U.K. by means unknown."" Haydon appealed for anyone who saw the three Russians in the U.K. in March 2018 to come forward. Online investigative website Bellingcat previously reported that Sergeev was a high-ranking GRU officer and a graduate of Russia's Military Diplomatic Academy. The website said he was suspected of involvement in the poisoning of an arms manufacturer, his son and a factory manager in Bulgaria in 2015. Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist with Bellingcat, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Sergeev appeared to have played a “coordinating, supervising” role in the Salisbury poisoning. Grozev called the Metropolitan Police force’s announcement a “validation” of the group’s findings about Sergeev. ___ Daria Litvinova and Daniel Kozin contributed to this report from Moscow."

Speaking after the state department put five Salvadoran supreme court justices on a list of “undemocratic and corrupt actors”, the US embassy chargé d’affaires in San Salvador said the action was taken because the justices voted to allow the president’s re-election, “which is clearly not allowed under the constitution”. “What are we seeing now? It is a decline in democracy, and that is exactly what is happening,” said Jean Manes. Bukele said the decision to put the Salvadoran justices on the list “has nothing to do with corruption”. He called it “pure politics and the lowest form of interventionism”. “We are nobody’s back yard,” Bukele wrote in his Twitter account. Over the weekend he changed his Twitter profile to “dictator”, in an apparently ironic reference to protests against him. By Tuesday he had changed it again to “the coolest dictator in the world”. Photograph: Twitter Bukele’s New Ideas party won a congressional majority this year and quickly replaced the five members of the constitutional chamber of the supreme court and the independent attorney general who had balked at several of Bukele’s earlier actions. Soon after, the constitutional chamber threw out what had long been interpreted as a constitutional ban on consecutive presidential re-election, setting the stage for Bukele to potentially seek a second term in 2024. Bukele has not so far announced plans to seek reelection. Bukele is a prolific Twitter user, and frequently posts memes promoting bitcoin, which was adopted as legal tender earlier this month. Last week, thousands of people gathered in El Salvador’s capital for the first mass demonstration against Bukele and his bitcoin policy.

The group opposed a proposal to place an iron cage over Chiang’s bronze statue at Taipei’s Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The Transitional Justice Commission should push ahead with its plan to take down the 6.3m statue and move it to the Cihu Mausoleum in Taoyuan’s Dasi District (大溪), former political prisoner Tsai Kuan-yu (蔡寬裕) said.

Photo: CNA “This has been enshrined in law, so the government must remove all symbols of authoritarianism that are still in place,” said Tsai, the honorary chairman of the Taiwan Association for the Care of the Victims of Political Persecution During the Martial Law Period. Tsai, now in his 80s, was targeted by the KMT’s persecution of dissidents and civil liberty advocates. He was imprisoned twice from the 1960s to the 1970s, spending a total of 13 years in prison. Article 5 of the Act on Promoting Transitional Justice (促進轉型正義條例), passed by the legislature in 2017, stipulates that “symbols appearing in public buildings or places that commemorate or express nostalgia for authoritarian rulers shall be removed, renamed, or dealt with in some other way,” Tsai said. “We have pressed the demand to remake Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall as part of the transitional justice process and get rid of the statue. Such a move has basis in the law and therefore should be implemented soon, but we only see inaction and more delays,” he said. Several consultation meetings were held over the past two months with officials from the Ministry of Culture department that manages the memorial hall, and several rounds of discussions were held with commission officials, Tsai said. “Our organization and other groups representing the victims of past political persecution have voiced their recommendations. We also spoke directly with the current and former minister of culture,” Tsai added. “They have our recommendations and should take action to implement them... It is painful to see Taiwan undergoing democratization for three decades and people still having a personality cult for the worship of a dictator,” he said. Only when the statue is removed from the memorial hall can the nation close this chapter of its history, Tsai said. “If not, the malevolence of the past authoritarian regime and the personality cult will remain alive, and our society will waste time squabbling over it year after year,” he said. Regarding the proposal to place an iron cage on the statue, Tsai said: “We disagree with such ways to cast aspersion on the statue... The best way is to remove it, without leaving a trace, which should end all disputes over the issue.” Meanwhile, the Taiwan 228 Care Association has launched a petition to terminate all government funding for ceremonial activities at the memorial hall, and to have Chiang’s descendants pay for the statue’s care."

General Assembly and repeated a call for a declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. ""I once again urge the community of nations to mobilize its strengths for the end-of-war declaration on the Korean Peninsula,"" Moon said in a speech to the annual gathering of the world body. ""I propose that three parties of the two Koreas and the U.S., or four parties of the two Koreas, the U.S. and China come together and declare that the War on the Korean Peninsula is over,"" he said. North Korea had long sought a formal end to the Korean War to replace the armistice that stopped the fighting but left it and the U.S.-led U.N. Command still technically at war. Moon, who has been active in trying to engage with North Korea throughout his presidency, has argued that such a declaration would encourage North Korea to give up to denuclearize. Washington has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the U.N. assembly and said the United States sought ""serious and sustained diplomacy to pursue the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" ""We seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the Peninsula and in the region, as well as improve the lives of the people in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,"" he said, using North Korea's official name.

Protesters dressed as construction workers clashed with police for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, assaulting officers, smashing police car windows, throwing bottles and stones, and damaging property. After gathering in the early morning, between 1,000 and 2,000 protesters, the vast majority of them young men, marched across Melbourne – paralysing the city and shutting down a major arterial bridge – chanting “fuck the jab” and “every day”, a reference to a promise to keep protesting daily until Melbourne’s Covid restrictions are lifted. Police said 62 protesters were arrested and three police officers were injured along with one journalist. Victoria’s police chief commissioner, Shane Patton, said officers used pepper balls, foam baton rounds, smoke bombs and stinger grenades which deploy rubber pellets. “These crowd control equipment munitions were necessary … because we can’t allow this type of conduct to go on,” he told reporters later in the day. Video footage on social media showed police cars trying to leave one area before a mob attacked the vehicles with bottles and smashed windows. A line of riot police, weapons raised, then drove the protesters back. This is seriously out of control and someone is going to get hurt. #GoHome now #Melbourne #protests pic.twitter.com/jgbpIKWMQx — Níal Ó Fionnagáin (@NialFinegan) September 21, 2021 “We will stop this protest,” Patton said. “We will then step back and investigate and hold those to account who need to be held to account. The message is clear – you can’t come in and break the law. We will hold you to account. Crowds like this are for cowards.” Patton said police had “intelligence” that protests were planned again for Wednesday and he implored people to stay at home. “No one benefits from this type of conduct, we will be out in force again, I can assure you of that,” he told reporters. “I won’t disclose what our tactics will be tomorrow, but they will be different. Please just stay home, we do not want a confrontation.” The protests started with members of the powerful Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), who were resisting a government mandate for compulsory vaccinations in order for them to continue to work on building sites. The union has said it is in favour of members being vaccinated but it opposes jabs being compulsory. However, the initial rally appeared to have been hijacked by far-right extremists, allegedly including neo-Nazis and anti-vaccination groups, who organised on Telegram, Facebook and WhatsApp. Many of them arrived at the protest dressed in hi-vis clothing. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The former union boss and ex-federal opposition leader Bill Shorten blamed far-right groups for driving the protest and the violence that ensued. Shorten labelled the protesters “man-baby Nazis”. It is not clear how many of the protesters on Tuesday were CFMEU members. The protests were not centrally organised but a list of demands circulated online called for an end to Covid lockdowns and mask mandates. There were calls for Australia’s mooted vaccine passports to be abandoned. Construction workers and demonstrators attend an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images The list also demanded the resignation of the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews, and called for the widespread distribution of unproven coronavirus treatment ivermectin. The premier on Tuesday evening said there was “no excuse for the terrible behaviour we have seen in our city over the past two days”. “Acts of violence and disruption won’t result in one less case of Covid – in fact, it only helps the virus to spread,” Andrews said. Victoria’s construction industry has been shut down for a fortnight because of high rates of Delta variant transmission and poor compliance with health orders on building sites. About 50% of building sites inspected failed Covid safety tests, the government has said. So-called “freedom” protests have been growing steadily more confrontational in Melbourne – and more difficult for police to control. A broader protest on Saturday also descended into violence with police overrun by protesters who, pushed out of the inner city, moved to suburban streets. More than 200 people were arrested in those protests and 10 police officers were injured, including three who were hospitalised with broken bones. On Tuesday morning, protesters gathered outside the CFMEU building in Melbourne’s CBD before marching to the steps of Parliament House, wearing hi-vis gear, chanting and setting off flares. Before the march began, police told the protesters to disperse, firing non-fatal pellets into the crowd. Cans and water bottles were thrown back at the police.

You have previously been directed to leave,” an officer within a line of riot police told the crowd. “Leave now or force may be used. No further warnings will be given.” After briefly facing off against riot police at the steps of parliament, the demonstrators headed to one of Melbourne’s major railway stations, Flinders Street, blocking traffic and trams and chanting “fuck [premier] Dan Andrews”, “freedom”, “fake news” and “fuck the jab”. Several journalists reporting on the protests were abused, assaulted and sprayed with what appeared to be urine. One television journalist was hit in the head with a full drink can thrown at him. The protesters continued on to the West Gate Freeway, where they walked to the top of the West Gate Bridge that links Melbourne’s east and west. Blocking bridge traffic in both directions, the protesters loudly sang the hit song The Horses – a 1990 cover version by Daryl Braithwaite is tenaciously popular in Australia – dancing and lighting flares before returning to the city and again clashing with riot police. On Monday, riot police were called in to disperse a group of about 500 protesters, who threw bottles at the Victorian CFMEU construction secretary, John Setka, and smashed the office’s door down. Setka said the protesters were not all CFMEU members and blamed “neo-Nazis and rightwing extremists” for hijacking the event. “There was a small minority of construction workers, some of them when it all got violent just walked away from it. It was hijacked by the professional protesters,” he said."

Massoud was joined a few days later by Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan vice president and longtime intelligence chief, who left Afghanistan by helicopter, the senior U.S. official and two former Afghan officials said. The retreat of the two key Afghan resistance figures contradicts public claims that they are still in Afghanistan and holding out against the Taliban and signals a remarkable shift in their fortunes: For the first time in decades, the United States government and the CIA do not appear to be backing them. Massoud and Saleh are both seeking military aid and equipment from the West, but the Biden administration is not supporting them and has given no indication of whether it will provide future assistance, according to the two former Afghan officials and a retired U.S. intelligence official. On Wednesday, Massoud hired Washington lobbyist Robert Stryk. Massoud and Saleh have been embraced by prominent Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is keen on the U.S. returning to Afghanistan. Neither Massoud nor Saleh has been seen in public since the Taliban took Panjshir. Both come from the mountainous northeastern province, a perennial base of Afghan resistance, first against the Soviet Union and later the Taliban. Massoud is currently in a “safe house” in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, according to a former senior Afghan government official who spoke with him last week, while Saleh is in a nearby location. Photo: Sajjad Hussain/AFP via Getty Images Saleh last tweeted on September 3, as the Taliban began encircling Panjshir. In an accompanying video, he dismissed reports that he had already fled Afghanistan as “totally baseless.” “The RESISTANCE is continuing and will continue,” Saleh tweeted. “I am here with my soil, for my soil & defending its dignity.” On Monday, Ali Maisam Nazary, a spokesperson for Massoud, told The Intercept that Massoud “is inside Afghanistan … in an undisclosed location.” Saleh could not be reached for comment. Saleh, who once worked as an aide to Ahmad Shah Massoud and served many years in senior positions in Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government, tweeted last month that he was the legal successor to former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, citing Ghani’s decision to flee to the United Arab Emirates. “As per d constitution of Afg, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President the FVP [First Vice President] becomes the caretaker President,” Saleh tweeted on August 16, the day after the Taliban seized control of Kabul. “I am currently inside my country & am the legitimate care taker President.”"

Known as the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, it was acquired by the company Hobby Lobby in 2014 for display in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. U.S. authorities seized it in 2019, saying it was stolen and needed to be returned. That return is happening Thursday at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. It is part of a group of about 17,000 looted antiquities that the U.S. agreed to return to Iraq. Some of them went back in July. ""By returning these illegally acquired objects, the authorities here in the United States and in Iraq are allowing the Iraqi people to reconnect with a page in their history,"" UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said in a statement. The tablet measures 5 by 6 inches. It features inscriptions in Sumerian, the language of the ancient Mesopotamian civilization. The text includes a section of the epic of Gilgamesh, a poem believed to have been written at least 4,000 years ago. During the Gulf War in 1991, Saddam Hussein's regime lost control of regions of Iraq and several regional museums were looted of historic objects, possibly including the tablet. By 2001, it had made its way to a London antiquities dealer, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Then it was on to antiquities dealers in the U.S. and then back to London where in 2014 the auction house Christie's sold it to Hobby Lobby for $1.67 million. Hobby Lobby sued Christie's, saying the auction house provided false documentation about the tablet's history. Christie's said it did not know the documents were false at the time. Hobby Lobby's owners are also the founders of the Museum of the Bible. The museum opened in 2017. Hobby Lobby President Steve Green began collecting artifacts in 2009 for the museum, but admits he knew little about collecting early on and did not adequately make sure that he was not buying stolen items. In 2017, Hobby Lobby agreed to pay a $3 million fine in a settlement with the Justice Department and agreed to return thousands of clay tablets that were illegally imported. Green announced in March 2020 that he would return 11,500 objects to the governments of Iraq and Egypt."

Addressing the UN General Assembly, Xi made the promise as he vowed to accelerate efforts to help the world battle the climate crisis. ""China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,"" Xi said in a pre-recorded address. ""We should foster new growth drivers in the post-Covid era and jointly achieve leapfrog development, staying committed to harmony between man and nature,"" Xi said. China has gone on an infrastructure-building blitz around the world as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, and until now has been open to coal projects. In a letter earlier this year, a coalition of non-governmental groups said that the state-run Bank of China was the largest single financier of coal projects, pumping $35 billion since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015. China, however, has kept investing in coal at home, preserving a form of industry that is also politically sensitive in the United States. China brought 38.4 gigawatts of new coal-fired power into operation last year -- more than three times what was brought on line globally. On a visit to China earlier this month, US climate envoy John Kerry said the United States has made it ""clear that the addition of more coal plants represents a significant challenge to the efforts of the world to deal with the climate crisis."" China has promised to peak coal consumption by 2030 and go carbon neutral by 2060. China's promise comes as momentum builds for a UN conference in November in Glasgow which aims to raise the ambitions of the Paris accord. © 2021 AFP"

Indian officials say they seized nearly three tonnes of heroin originating from Afghanistan worth an estimated 200bn rupees ($2.72bn) amid the chaos following last month’s takeover of the country by the Taliban. India’s top anti-smuggling agency, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), seized two containers at Mundra Port in the western state of Gujarat on September 15 after receiving intelligence they contained narcotics, according to a Gujarat official speaking anonymously. More than 2,988kg (6,590 pounds) of heroin was recovered in one of India’s biggest such hauls to date. Two people have been arrested in connection with the haul and investigations were ongoing, the official in Gujarat, who is not authorised to speak publicly, said.   The containers had been imported by a firm in the southern coastal city of Vijayawada, the official added “Investigation conducted so far has also revealed the involvement of Afghan nationals, who are under investigation.” DRI officials declined to comment. The narcotics were headed to New Delhi and the two arrested people had sought an import-export licence based on a home address in the southern city of Vijayawada, police in Vijayawada said in a statement on Monday. The containers’ cargo had been declared as semi-processed talc stones from Afghanistan and had been shipped from Bandar Abbas Port in Iran to Mundra, the official said, adding that forensic tests confirmed the presence of heroin. Afghanistan is the world’s biggest illicit opiate supplier, but since taking power, the Taliban has said it plans to ban the drug trade, without giving details on how."

""One of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable, so we need to know what happened and why,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in defence of France. Her EU executive asked for preparatory EU discussions for the U.S. trade and technology council to be taken off Wednesday's agenda, EU diplomats said. A spokesperson said the Commission was still determining whether the U.S. meeting should go ahead as planned.

Lithuania's deputy European affairs minister Arnoldas Pranckevicius referred to a ""transatlantic mistrust"" that needed to be resolved. The dispute follows what NATO's European allies say was Washington's failure to communicate and consult during the chaotic Western withdrawal from Afghanistan. Australia says the United States' offer of access to U.S. nuclear technology to build nuclear-propelled submarines was too good to refuse. It will be only the second country after Britain in 1958 to be given such technology that allows Canberra to help Washington prevent China from gaining military supremacy.

The photo was captioned “Let’s go for pizza with Coca Cola.” The Brazilian president is the only G20 leader who has not been vaccinated for the coronavirus and has repeatedly defended his decision, citing his battle with COVID-19 last year. “Why take the vaccine? To have antibodies, isn’t that right? My antibody levels are way up high,” he said last week. The UN has permitted unvaccinated delegates to attend the General Assembly, which starts Tuesday with a speech from the Brazilian president.

The ruling found that ""Russia was responsible for assassination of Aleksandr Litvinenko in the UK."" ""The Court found in particular that there was a strong prima facie case that, in poisoning Mr Litvinenko, Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun had been acting as agents of the Russian State,"" it said, referring to the names of two Russian agents accused of killing Litvinenko. The court also ruled that Russian authorities ""had not carried out an effective domestic investigation capable of leading to the establishment of the facts and, where appropriate, the identification and punishment of those responsible for the murder."" The ECHR verdict supports the findings of a 2016 British inquiry that found that the two Russian agents poisoned Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his green tea with the highly radioactive polonium-210. In a statement from his deathbed in London in November 2006, Litvinenko said he had no doubt about who was to blame for his imminent death.

MUST WATCH Not the first time Russia linked to poisoning 02:56 ""You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life,"" he said. The British inquiry said that Putin ""probably approved"" the ex-spy's killing. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation, as did the two agents accused of the poisoning, whom the Russian government has refused to extradite to the UK. On Tuesday, the ECHR said that ""the court found it established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the assassination had been carried out by Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun."" ""The planned and complex operation involving the procurement of a rare deadly poison, the travel arrangements for the pair, and repeated and sustained attempts to administer the poison indicated that Mr Litvinenko had been the target of the operation,"" it said. The ECHR ruling concluded that if the men been carrying out a ""rogue operation,"" it would be up to Russian authorities to prove that theory. ""However, the government had made no serious attempt to provide such information or to counter the findings of the UK authorities,"" it said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pushed back on the ruling Tuesday, saying that Moscow was ""not ready to take cue from such conclusions,"" and that ""it is unlikely that the ECHR has the authority or the technological capabilities to have information on this matter."" ""As you know, there are still no results of this investigation, so making such statements is at least unfounded,"" Peskov said, referring to a domestic criminal investigation launched in December 2006 that the ECHR said they have few details about. Spy-turned-whistleblower Litvinenko had worked for the FSB, Russia's successor agency to the KGB, the former Soviet secret police and intelligence agency. While his specialty was in tackling organized crime, his last job at the agency, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was heading up its anti-corruption department. From that position, he made many enemies. In 1998, he went public with allegations that he had been asked to examine the possibility of assassinating a wealthy businessman. He was subsequently fired from the agency, and fled Russia, according to the ECHR. He also blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. In 2001 Litvinenko and his family were granted asylum in the UK, acquiring British citizenship in 2006. His widow, Marina , who now is known as Maria Anna Carter and still lives in London, brought the case to the ECHR in 2007. Litvinenko is not the first Putin critic to be allegedly poisoned. In 2018, the former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were sickened by Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, In Salisbury, England. British prosecutors charged two Russian nationals , -- who have now been officially identified as officers of the Russian military intelligence service, Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin -- over the poisonings that year. London Metropolitan police authorized charges against a third Russian intelligence agent, identified as Denis Sergeev, aka ""Sergey Fedotov,"" on Tuesday."

The pro-Kremlin United Russia party won a landslide victory in Russia’s State Duma elections over the weekend, securing 324 of the lower chamber’s 450 seats — a supermajority that allows them to enact changes to the constitution. Russia’s opposition has alleged massive election fraud, and videos flooded social media during the vote showing apparent ballot stuffing. Questions have also been raised over a significant delay in the publication of online voting results in the capital Moscow, which eventually overhauled the voting leads secured in the offline vote by opposition candidates. Independent data scientists and analysts said Tuesday that half of all the votes attributed to United Russia in the official results were probably fake — a level of falsification previously unseen in Russian parliamentary elections. Prominent physicist Sergei Shpilkin, who has become well-known for his post-election data analysis of possible fraud, estimated on Tuesday that genuine support for United Russia was around 31-33%, while actual nationwide turnout was probably 38%. That compares with official results that saw United Russia score 50% on an official turnout of 52% — suggesting that around 14 million of United Russia’s official votes were fraudulent. The analysis is based on analyzing results across Russia’s 97,000 individual polling stations to find anomalies and outliers that hint at possible falsification. Statisticians focus on the host of polling stations that recorded high turnout and high vote shares for United Russia — a strong correlation that hints at ballot stuffing."

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email Here are some of the big questions that will be answered when votes are counted A voter, seen in this image taken from the door of a polling station, casts a ballot in Toronto's University-Rosedale riding on Sept. 20, 2021. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) Millions of Canadians will vote today, casting their ballot to help decide which party will form the next government. The CBC's Poll Tracker shows a statistical tie between the Liberals and Conservatives in the popular vote, but today is when that political cliché becomes the truth — the only poll that matters is the one on election night. Here are a few things to watch when results start to come in. ADVERTISEMENT Delayed full results The first thing is how long it actually takes for enough votes to be counted to get a sense of the result. The majority of anticipated votes in this election will be counted as they always are, by hand after polls close. Votes cast in advance polls will also be counted at this time, although returning offices can start that process an hour before polls close at the discretion of the returning officer. People wait in line at an Ottawa advance polling station. (Francis Ferland/CBC) Special ballots from Canadians outside of their ridings (including outside the country, such as members of the Armed Forces deployed overseas) are already being counted. RESULTS Get live results from the federal election What's different about this election is that hundreds of thousands of Canadians are mailing ballots from within their ridings, and those ballots are subject to additional verification processes. So, Elections Canada won't be counting them until Tuesday. If the election is as close as it seems, Canadians may not know the full results until Tuesday at the earliest. ADVERTISEMENT Voter turnout in a pandemic As of Sunday, 1,262,617 special ballot kits had been issued by Elections Canada, and 923,832 had been returned. The high number of Canadians voting by mail from their own ridings is one sign of how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed this election. But it's unclear right now how much it will affect turnout on election day itself. In-person voting at advance polls was actually substantially higher than in 2019, with approximately 5,780,000 votes cast from Sept. 10-13, Elections Canada estimates. Whether the roughly 18.5 per cent increase over 2019 is because Canadians were trying to avoid crowds on election day, or because of the long-standing trend in increased advance turnout, or some other reason related to the pandemic is unclear. And beyond the effects of the pandemic, it's always worth watching how many Canadians make the time to take part in the democratic process. ADVERTISEMENT Ministers losing their seats Several Liberal cabinet ministers are at risk of losing their seats in tight races across the country. Atlantic Canada seems unlikely to boot any of the cabinet ministers representing provinces there, so the first seats Canadians should watch for are probably in Quebec and Ontario. Jean-Yves Duclos, president of the Treasury Board, won his seat by a few hundred votes in 2019. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) In Quebec, Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos won the Quebec City riding of Québec by less than one per cent last time and will be looking to defend against another push from the Bloc Québécois. Then there's National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier in Gaspésie–Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who is likely to also face a strong Bloc challenge today. In Ontario, Maryam Monsef has been targeted by the Conservatives in her bellwether riding of Peterborough–Kawartha. And in the Greater Toronto Area, seniors minister Deb Schulte is fighting a Conservative challenger in King–Vaughan. The PPC effect The People's Party of Canada, which received just 1.62 per cent of the vote in 2019, is now polling at almost 7 per cent, according to the Poll Tracker. It's not clear if Maxime Bernier's party will have enough concentrated support to win a seat, including his own former riding of Beauce, Que., but his party could play spoiler for the Conservatives. If the PPC receives even a few percentage points of support that might otherwise have gone to the Conservatives, it could result in splits that deny the Tories key swing ridings. ADVERTISEMENT Bernier has pushed a message that is against mandatory vaccinations and vaccine passports, as well as anti-lockdown.

Wracked by internal fighting ahead of the election, the Greens are running only 252 candidates in Canada's 338 ridings. Leader Annamie Paul has left Toronto Centre, the riding she is contesting, only a few times in the 36-day campaign. After Jenica Atwin crossed the floor to the Liberals in June, the Greens are down to two MPs — Paul Manly in Nanaimo–Ladysmith and former leader Elizabeth May in Saanich–Gulf Islands. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul takes part in the federal election English-language leaders debate in Gatineau, Que., on Sept. 9. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Despite a debate performance that was positively received by many, the Greens are polling the worst of any major federal party, so a key thing to watch is where all those votes will go, particularly in key ridings in British Columbia. Key regional outcomes In 2019, the story coming out of the election was one of alienation in Western Canada. The Liberals did not win a seat between Winnipeg and the B.C. border with Alberta. Today, polls suggest Conservative support in the region is softer, and the NDP and Liberals may be able to breach the blue wall in some major downtown cores, such as Calgary and Edmonton. ADVERTISEMENT Just a few seats in those cities could be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. The same thing can be said about the country's biggest city and environs. While only a few seats appear to be in play in Toronto proper, its suburbs are swingy and have been targeted by the Liberal and Conservative campaigns. Signs for candidates Anna Roberts (Conservative), Gilmar Oprisan (PPC) and Deb Schulte (Liberal) in the riding of King–Vaughan. (Jennifer Chevalier/CBC) The Conservatives are looking to take away some seats in that ring of ridings, often called the 905, to stoke their chances of forming a government. Conversely, the Liberals must protect the 905 to keep their hopes afloat. Finally, a complex set of vote splits and shifts could play out in Quebec, where many ridings have three or even four strong contenders, leading to incredibly unpredictable races with tight margins. The Bloc is looking to hold and even build on its 2019 resurgence, while the Liberals need Quebec seats. The Conservatives are eyeing a few pickups, while the NDP hopes to retain Alexandre Boulerice's lone orange riding and, ideally, sneak a couple more victories. The impact of a question in the English leaders debate earlier this month — and subsequent accusations of ""Quebec bashing"" have further added to the volatility in the race and buoyed what had previously been a flagging Bloc campaign.

In a video message to an international conference on safeguarding and the Church, that begins in Warsaw, Poland today, Pope Francis says that care for children should not be sidelined in favour of managing the Church’s reputation. “Only by facing the truth of these cruel behaviours and humbly seeking the forgiveness of the victims and survivors, will the Church be able to find its way to be once again confidently considered a place of welcome and safety for those in need,” the Pope says. “Our expressions of contrition must be converted into a concrete path of reform, both to prevent further abuse and to guarantee others the confidence that our efforts will lead to real and reliable change.” Recognising mistakes and failures can “make us feel vulnerable and fragile, for sure’, he concedes. “But it can also be a time of splendid grace, a time of emptying, which opens up new horizons of love and mutual service. If we recognise our mistakes, we will have nothing to fear, because it will be the Lord himself who will have led us to that point.” The international conference on the protection of vulnerable children and adults for the Churches of Central and Eastern Europe, organised by the Vatican’s Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and the Polish Bishops' Conference, continues until 22 September. Its theme is: Our Common Mission of Safeguarding God’s Children. Those taking part include representatives of bishops’ conferences, religious orders and lay professionals from 20 countries. Pope Francis refers to the “very serious upheaval” the Church is facing as a result of “the crisis of child sexual abuse by Church members”. In few places has this been more seriously witnessed than in Poland itself, where as Derek Scally reported recently in The Tablet, the Church has fallen hard from the triumphalism of Pope John Paul II’s visit in 1979 to shame and disgrace as more details of sexual abuse and cover up emerge. Scally reported that a 2020 study of church records going back to 1950 indicates that almost 400 Catholic priests had sexually abused more than 600 children. In a report released in June, the Church revealed that 368 allegations of clerical abuse had been reported to bishops in the previous two-and-a-half years; 292 priests and Religious were alleged to have abused over 300 boys and girls between 1958 and 2020. In July a state commission on paedophilia found that, of the 345 cases of paedophile assaults on children reported to the police in the last three years, priests or Religious made up almost a third of abusers or accessories. Pope Francis, in his video message to the conference in Warsaw, refers to his address to the leaders of the Bishops’ Conferences of the world in Rome in February 2019, when he expressed his encouragement to ensure that the welfare of the victims was not sidelined in favour of a misunderstood concern for the reputation of the Church as an institution. He says in his video message: “I encourage you to listen to the call of the victims and to commit yourselves, with one another and with society in the broader sense, in these important discussions as they truly touch the future of the Church in Central and Eastern Europe.”"

A powerful mix of insecurity and traditional prejudice against more liberal female politicians put Awatef Rasheed off running for parliament when she returned to Iraq in 2014 after years abroad. Seven years later, with Iraq less unstable, Rasheed has decided to contest a Oct. 10 election for the assembly, even if abuse and intimidation of women would-be lawmakers persist. Today, she is one of the 951 women, representing close to 30% of the total number of candidates, running for election to the country's 329-seat Council of Representatives. Passing a new domestic violence law, and more representation for women in the executive branch of government, are among the goals of some of the would-be female lawmakers. For Iraq's women politicians, elections can be an excruciating experience. Rasheed scrolled through her smartphone and looked at pictures of one of her campaign banners that had been ripped up, with the tear precisely crossing the image of her face. ""Out of 38 banners we put up in my city of Basra, 28 were damaged and four disappeared"", she said. Back in 2000, Rasheed had fled Saddam Hussein's regime to Canada, where she first started to campaign for women's social and political empowerment. It led to a career path she continued after returning to Iraq. But at the time ""political parties did not easily accept women like me, who have a gender perspective"", she said, adding her family also worried about Iraq's political violence. Discrimination still looms large, although Iraq this year introduced steps to protect women candidates. They can directly report violence to judicial investigators instead of having to notify the police first. The interior ministry has dedicated hotlines to receive complaints from women candidates. Human rights activist Hanaa Edwar said in elections in 2018 female candidates were subjected to defamation, smears and threats, abuses which deterred some from running this year. RELATED Nourzan's murder brings focus on domestic violence in Iraq Society Domestic violence Edwar had worked to advance women in politics in 2003 after Saddam's fall, in a campaign that sought a gender quota of at least 40% in parliament and government. In the end, a quota was introduced guaranteeing women 25% of parliamentary seats. Nada al-Jubori, a medical doctor and politician, has been elected to parliament through the gender quota twice since 2005. ""Defending women’s issues has never been easy”, Jubori told Reuters from her office in Baghdad's Adhamiya neighbourhood. She cited years of violence, sectarian strife and tribal pressure as additional challenges for women trying to put their agendas forward in parliament. Religious political parties expect their female members to be adopt their mostly conservative social agenda, she said. Ola al-Tamimi, 35, an engineer and candidate of the secular National Awareness Movement, is among a new generation of women entering politics for the first time. To her, passing a new domestic violence law is a pressing issue. ""Women remain marginalised and the amount of domestic violence in Iraq is dangerous,"" she said. ""Passing a law against domestic violence is very important, and it really requires the unity of women."" Women’s rights advocates who have campaigned for a domestic violence law for about 10 years want to introduce shelters for victims of domestic violence and stricter punishment of so-called honour crimes, for example the murder of a woman accused of shaming her family. But opposition, mostly from religious parties, means no law has so far been adopted. Beyond parliament, Jubori wants to see a better representation of women in the executive. In the current government, only three women have ministerial positions. According to Jubori, more women should be nominated to top jobs in public institutions to enable them to acquire political capital and visibility over time. ""They will get the chance to become better known and increase their resources, so that in future elections, we won't need the quota anymore."" (Reuters)"

With virtually all ballots counted, Russia’s election’s commission said United Russia had taken nearly 50% of the vote and won nearly 90% of first-past-the-post districts, meaning the party will retain its two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament, which allows it to change Russia’s constitution. Russia’s elections are closely managed, and the pro-Kremlin party’s victory was seen as a foregone conclusion, but on Monday, opposition parties accused the Kremlin of using blatant fabrication to inflate the result and produce an overwhelming win even in Moscow, usually a center of dissent. After polls closed Sunday night after three days of voting, early partial results showed several opposition parties and politicians making strong showings in the capital, with some seemingly in reach of victory with most votes counted. But those results were all wiped out when, after many hours, authorities published results from online voting, which handed victories to pro-Kremlin candidates. Opposition parties, even those from the so-called ""loyal opposition,"" cried foul, accusing the Kremlin of using the online votes to conceal vote manipulation and steal victory for its candidates. The Communist Party, which largely acts as a tame opposition in the parliament, said it would not recognize the results in Moscow, where six of its candidates lost out once the online votes were added. Critics started raising suspicions about Moscow’s online count after it took far longer for it to be completed than the paper ballot count for most of the rest of the country -- a sign, critics said, that officials were waiting to see how much they needed to alter the vote. The online voting was in effect a black box, with independent monitors unable to observe it or properly check how the results were signed off on by officials, independent monitors said. Workers at state companies and organizations have also reported being pressed by their managers to vote online en masse. Several candidates called a protest at Moscow’s Pushkin Square on Monday. A few hundred people gathered under heavy rain to demonstrate, watched by a cordon of riot police. ""Such a giant difference between the results at the 'live' polling stations and the online vote can’t be true,"" Mikhail Lobanov, a Communist candidate with wide support among liberal voters, told the crowd, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Lobanov said he had been on track to beat Yevgeny Popov, a pro-Kremlin TV personality, by a margin of 10,500 votes before the online votes suddenly gave Popov a lead of 20,000 votes at the last moment. There were also allegations of widespread analogue ballot rigging around Russia. Throughout the weekend, there was a stream of videos seeming to show elections officials stuffing wads of ballots into voting urns or trying to block monitoring cameras while others did so. Independent researchers also spotted that Russia's central elections committee now encrypts the results data published on its website, a step reportedly intended to prevent researchers from crunching the data themselves, which in the past has allowed them to identify signs of rigging. ""Online voting represents right now represents an absolute evil -- a black box that no one checks,"" Sergey Shpilkin, a data scientist who in the past has used statistical analysis to demonstrate likely falsification in Russian elections, told Russian news website Meduza. The head of Russia’s elections commission Ella Pamfilova in a video meeting with Putin said the elections had seen far fewer violations than usual and claimed Russia’s system was ""one of the most transparent"" in the world. The United States and some European countries criticized the elections as unfair amid the Kremlin's use of repressive laws to prevent opponents from participating. Ned Price, the U.S. State Department's spokesperson, in a statement said the Russian government had conducted ""widespread efforts to marginalize independent political figures"" and had ""severely restricted political pluralism and prevented the Russian people from exercising their civil and political rights."" United Russia took nearly 50% of the vote despite polls suggesting its support was around 30%, as high food prices and unpopular pension reforms have eaten into its popularity. Ahead of the elections, the Kremlin launched a campaign of repression on a scale unprecedented under Putin’s 20 year-rule, barring dozens of opposition candidates from running, with many arrested and some forced abroad. It dismantled the movement of its fiercest critic Alexey Navalny, who was jailed in January after surviving a nerve agent poisoning last year. Navalny, from jail, had sought to exploit the Kremlin party’s unpopularity at the elections with a tactical voting campaign called ""Smart Voting,"" advising people to vote for any candidate with the best chance of beating United Russia. On Monday, he claimed the campaign had worked, arguing the campaign’s recommended candidates had won 12 out of Moscow’s 15 districts before the online votes were added. The Communist Party notably improved their share of the vote across Russia, taking around 19%, up from 13% five years ago, in a sign of a growing protest vote among Russians weary with Putin’s two-decade rule, experts said. Several opposition figures and election monitors alleged the fraud in these elections was worse than in 2012, when a rigged parliamentary election prompted mass street protests, the largest ever under Putin. This year, there appeared no sign those protests would be repeated amid a far more repressive environment in Russia. And though Navalny's team said they would support any peaceful demonstrations called to protest the falsification, they did not call for any themselves."

Major banks have reportedly been told that they won't receive interest payments on loans that are due Monday, while interest payments of $84m (£61m) on the firm's bonds are also due on Thursday. The company's shares fell by more than 10% in Hong Kong trade on Monday. The property giant's deepening debt problems have triggered fears over the impact its potential collapse could have on China's economy. Why is Evergrande in trouble? Evergrande grew to be one of China's biggest companies by borrowing more than $300bn (£217bn). Last year, Beijing brought in new rules to control the amount owed by big real estate developers. The new measures led Evergrande to offer its properties at major discounts to ensure money was coming in to keep the business afloat. Now, it is struggling to meet the interest payments on its debts. This uncertainty has seen Evergrande's share price tumble by around 85% this year. Its bonds have also been downgraded by global credit ratings agencies. Why would it matter if Evergrande collapses? There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system. ""The financial fallout would be far reaching. Evergrande reportedly owes money to around 171 domestic banks and 121 other financial firms,"" the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Mattie Bekink told the BBC. If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. Is Evergrande 'too big to fail'? The very serious potential fallout of such a heavily-indebted company collapsing has led some analysts to suggest that Beijing may step in to rescue it. The EIU's Mattie Bekink thinks so: ""Rather than risk disrupting supply chains and enraging homeowners, we think the government will probably find a way to ensure Evergrande's core business survives."" Others though are not sure. In a post on China's chat app and social media platform WeChat, the influential editor-in-chief of state-backed Global Times newspaper Hu Xijin said Evergrande should not rely on a government bailout and instead needs to save itself. This also chimes with Beijing's aim to rein in corporate debt, which means that such a high profile bailout could be seen as setting a bad example. What does Evergrande do? Businessman Hui Ka Yan founded Evergrande, formerly known as the Hengda Group, in 1996 in Guangzhou, southern China. Evergrande Real Estate currently owns more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities across China. The broader Evergrande Group now encompasses far more than just real estate development. Its businesses range from wealth management, making electric cars and food and drink manufacturing. It even owns one of country's biggest football teams - Guangzhou FC. Mr Hui has a personal fortune of around $10.6bn, according to Forbes.

It shone brightly for a full six months before it disappeared. Astronomers haven't been able to identify the remnant of the source for SN 1181 for centuries, and that detail is crucial to determine which class the supernova belongs to. Now, an international team of astronomers think they have pinpointed that source as one of the hottest stars in the galaxy within the Pa30 nebula, according to a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. As we've written previously, there are two types of known supernova, depending on the mass of the original star. An iron-core collapse supernova occurs with massive stars (greater than ten solar masses), which collapse so violently that it causes a huge, catastrophic explosion. The temperatures and pressures become so high that the carbon in the star's core begins to fuse. This halts the core's collapse, at least temporarily, and this process continues, over and over, with progressively heavier atomic nuclei. When the fuel finally runs out entirely, the (by then) iron core collapses into a black hole or a neutron star. Then there is a thermonuclear supernova. Smaller stars (up to about eight solar masses) gradually cool to become dense cores of ash known as white dwarfs. If a white dwarf that has run out of nuclear fuel is part of a binary system, it can siphon off matter from its partner, adding to its mass until its core reaches high enough temperatures for carbon fusion to occur. Advertisement There are also rarer types of supernovae. Among the earliest and most famous ""guest stars"" was recorded by Chinese astronomers around July 4, 1054. It was visible in broad daylight for 23 days. The remnants now form the Crab Nebula. Some have hypothesized that SN 1054 was a so-called ""electron-capture"" supernova, first described some 40 years ago. If that is indeed the case, SN 1054 has a 21st-century cousin. Back in June, we reported that a team of astronomers had identified a second recent supernova—dubbed SN 2018zd—that meets all the criteria for an electron-capture supernova. In this scenario, a star isn't heavy enough to produce an iron core collapse supernova, yet it's not light enough to prevent its core from collapsing entirely. Instead, such stars stop the fusion process when their cores are composed of oxygen, neon, and magnesium. In this scenario, electrons get gobbled up by the neon and magnesium in the core, thereby causing the core to buckle under its own weight. The end result is a supernova. According to this new analysis, SN 1181 appears to belong to another relatively rare category known as Type Iax. It's related to the Type Ia category, in which the supernova is the result of a binary star system where one of the two stars is a white dwarf. Typically, the white dwarf siphons off hydrogen and helium from its companion star, eventually hitting a critical mass and exploding, destroying the white dwarf in the process. But there are cases, such as with SN 2012Z, where the white dwarf only loses half its mass and leaves behind a zombie star as a remnant. ""SN 1181 was until now the only remaining historical supernova of the last millennium without a certain counterpart,"" the authors wrote. For years, the most likely candidate remnant was a radio and x-ray pulsar known as 3C-58, which currently rotates about 15 times per second. That would mean the pulsar hasn't lost much rotational energy over the last 900 years. SN 1054's remnant, the Crab Nebula, in contrast, has lost roughly two-thirds of its rotational energy. And according to recent radio surveys of 3C-58, the pulsar is likely much older than SN 1181 and hence could not be the remnant. Advertisement Enter the disk-like nebula Pa30, first discovered by astronomers in 2013. Pa30 surrounds a rare, massive Wolf-Rayet star known as Parker's Star. The authors determined that the dust and gas in Pa30 is expanding at more than 1100 km/sec, and the team used that velocity to derive the nebula's age: about 1,000 years. This makes it an excellent candidate for the remnant of SN 1181. “The historical reports place the guest star between two Chinese constellations, Chuanshe and Huagai. Parker’s Star fits the position well,"" said co-author Albert Zijlstra of the University of Manchester. ""That means both the age and location fit with the events of 1181.” Astronomers had previously hypothesized that Pa30 and Parker's Star resulted from the collision and ensuing merger of two white dwarf stars, producing a Type Iax supernova, and Zijlstra et al.'s findings are in keeping with that hypothesis. “Only around 10 percent of supernovae are of this type and they are not well understood,"" said Zijlstra. ""The fact that SN1181 was faint but faded very slowly fits this type. It is the only such event where we can study both the remnant nebula and the merged star and also have a description of the explosion itself. It is nice to be able to solve both a historical and an astronomical mystery.” DOI: Astrophysical Journal Letters, 2021. 10.3847/2041-8213/ac2253 (About DOIs)."

According to the police report, a 49-year-old man is suspected of having shot the gas station employee Saturday evening, over a mask-wearing requirement at the establishment. What happened at the gas station? The man is said to have entered the gas station to make a purchase without wearing a face mask and the 20-year-old employee asked him to comply with the regulation. The two allegedly got into an argument, which prompted the maskless man to leave. But according to police, the man is said to have returned roughly an hour later. This time, he was wearing a mask but he took it off and the two men started another argument. The suspect then pulled a concealed revolver out of his pocket and shot the 20-year-old. Senior public prosecutor Kai Fuhrmann told DPA that the victim died after a fatal shot to the head. After the incident, the suspect is said to have fled on foot. What did the suspect say? Authorities arrived at the scene and started a search for the man. But the following day, the 49-year-old walked into the police station and confessed to the crime. The man allegedly told officers that he was against COVID-19 restrictive measures and that the coronavirus pandemic situation had greatly stressed him, Fuhrmann said. He felt cornered and ""saw no other way out"" than to set an example. The suspect held the victim ""responsible for the overall situation, because he enforced the rules,"" Fuhrmann added.

It's the first sex worker justice group to do so in Canada. Photo courtesy of Maggie's. Sachi Keller, known by fans as Onyx, is an Alberta-based stripper who says she’s experienced pay-docking and long shifts without breaks. As one of the few Black strippers in the province, she’s also been told to avoid wearing braids, and instead, keep her hair straight, all while club managers say “We’re not racist; we hired you.” Earlier this year, Keller lost her employment altogether when she spoke out against her working conditions. Specifically, she repeatedly asked one of her employers to stop taking money from her paycheque for a “promo fee.” Advertisement “I went on social media and talked about it—look at these deductions—and the next day they fired me,” Keller said. So Keller was happy to hear that Maggie’s, Canada’s oldest sex worker organization based in Toronto, has become the first of its kind to unionize in the country under the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). “Having a union will organize better standards, expectations, and accountability, which is especially needed when there are problems with people you’re working with, like managers and club owners,” Keller said. Jassie Justice, an outreach worker at Maggie’s who led union efforts, said unionizing allows staff to tangibly address racism, transphobia, low wages, and too few working hours for staff. “It’s hard advocating for yourself as a worker of colour in an organization that historically has been very white,” they said, adding that while Maggie’s has “incredible” staff of colour, “unionizations allows us to talk about white supremacy in the context of real working conditions.” “Even the most progressive organization can benefit from a union,” they said. While the union only represents Maggie’s staff, Keller and other sex workers across Canada told VICE World News they hope the move sparks a nationwide trend. Ideally, sex workers say, unions make it possible for workers to collectively force employers to give them paid time off, paternity leave, and meaningful ways to address violations and abuses incurred on the job. Advertisement Pay-docking could also be tackled. When Keller first spoke out about her pay getting slashed, she tried to speak with her agent. Many strippers across Canada have to go through third-party agencies to book gigs at clubs, so they’re subject to the ways they’re treated by club management and by the agents coordinating their work. When it comes to pay, agencies take a cut, and often, clubs use pay docking as a way to penalize strippers for being late or failing to hit various targets. “It’s straight-up extortion,” one stripper previously told VICE World News. Instead of advocating for Keller, her agent dropped all forthcoming bookings, she said. “He said, “We’re going to part ways from here.’ He didn't want to hear my story.” The agency, Independent Artists, did not respond to VICE World News’ requests for comment. Keller acknowledged that some sex workers don’t want to unionize, in part because they’re worried about the repercussions they might face from employers, including fewer bookings. To make matters worse, there isn’t enough government oversight protecting sex workers, including strippers, Keller said. “If this was any other occupation—if we were working in nail salons—it would be a completely different reaction from authorities,” Keller said. “We know governments don’t like strippers, but we’re here. It’s a business; we’re workers, so we should get the same rights and privileges as others.” Keller has since advocated for stripper rights, in part by setting up a site where performers can share their stories of being mistreated. “I love my job, but the companies make it difficult to want to do this sometimes,” one anonymous stripper wrote. Advertisement Fatphobia and ageism as well as poor travel accommodations, unstable contract work, and “huge” favouritism also plague the working conditions that many strippers live with in Canada, said Steph Sia, a stripper based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Similar problems inspired a U.K.-based sex worker union in 2019. “I think pretty much every dancer has experienced discrimination at some point. It’s the same as being a woman in any workplace!” one dancer told VICE at the time. Following unionization in the U.K., employers started listening to workers more, and even hired staff to manage worker concerns. Around the world, including in the Netherlands and Spain, sex worker unions also support collective efforts to decriminalize the industry, which would help remove the stigma around sex work and make it safer. Right now, most sex workers don’t report labour violations and others abuses out of fear they’ll be neglected or punished by authorities. Sia said it’s important to keep in mind that the good parts of sex work—freedom of expression, good pay, creativity—outweigh the bad, but solid labour rights would make the work even better. “A lot of my peers want to gain benefits and fight for more consistent pay and rights… That would help create better working conditions, safety, security,” Sia said, adding that following Maggie’s union drive, “I’d hope to see a trend nationally, across the board.” When Jassie Justice learned that other sex workers were excited about Maggie’s union efforts, they said they’re “thrilled about it.” “I see this as a means to talk more holistically about sex work justice and understanding sex work as work, and affording the rights that should be afforded to all workers to sex workers,” Jassie Justice said."

They will head to Saskatoon within the next three weeks, Canada’s immigration minister confirmed on Sunday. The group of about 200 Afghans spent weeks trying to find a safe route to evade the Taliban, which recently reclaimed political control of the country and opposes the education of women.

Fell said the Prince’s Trust wholeheartedly supports the choice of city the group will soon call home. “The Canadian government selected Saskatoon,” he said. “It’s a fantastic place for them to settle.” Another smaller contingent of female students, who managed to escape with the main group, have travelled to Mexico, a spokesman for the immigration minister said. 1:54 Afghan refugees grateful to settle into ‘bright future’ in Calgary Afghan refugees grateful to settle into ‘bright future’ in Calgary The Canadian Press has agreed not to share details of where the girls are from or where they were being educated for security reasons.

That's according to aerial drone research by scientists in Washington state, and it has researchers in B.C. hopeful that the three mothers-to-be will overcome tough odds and help bring their species back from the brink. The three presumed pregnancies were discovered by two scientists in the U.S., Holly Fearnbach and John Durban, who collaborate often with B.C. experts, said the director of Ocean Wise's marine mammals research group. ""It's pretty exciting and it's very significant,"" Lance Barrett-Lennard told CBC News. ""The southern resident population of which [the] J-pod belongs to is critically endangered."" ""In most years they have no reproduction at all. So having three pregnancies is good, it's exciting. This is what the pod needs."" Having three pregnancies is good. It's exciting. This is what the pod needs. - Lance Barrett-Lennard, UBC There are currently only 74 southern resident orcas left, down from more than 90 in the 1970s. The three pregnancies are in what scientists call the ""J-pod,"" a group of southern resident killer whales. Members of the pod are named starting with the letter ""J"" and a number; the three mothers-to-be are J19, J36 and J37. University of British Columbia researcher Josh McInnes, with the marine mammal research unit at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, said that although killer whales have a high rate of miscarriages and infant mortality, he and other researchers are ""excited"" and ""hopeful"" at least some of the three pregnancies will help rebuild the endangered species' population. WATCH | Experts perplexed by disappearance of killer whales: Disappearance of killer whales a mystery to experts 2:10 Experts say they’re not sure why orca whales haven’t been seen along the coastline of Vancouver Island this year. There are two theories floating around: a lack of Chinook salmon and a change in whale leadership. 2:10 ""Having three calves being born that could possibly survive ... it might just help a little,"" he said. ""The first year is critical; killer whales have a 50-50 chance of survival especially in the first year."" 'Fingers crossed that they are successful and the calves survive' But he cautioned that neonatal mortality of killer whale calves is ""quite high"" alongside miscarriages, and many of the threats to orca survival continue to put them at risk. But the recently discovered pregnancies appear to be fairly advanced in their terms. ""Fingers crossed that they are successful and the calves survive,"" he said. A series of miscarriages have made headlines in recent years, raising fears of the continued decline of the orcas. With such a small overall population, the risks of collapse are real. In 2018, one female orca, J35, carried her stillborn baby for more than two weeks in the water in what experts called a ""tour of grief."" But two years later, she gave birth to a healthy baby. Barrett-Lennard described the U.S. scientists behind the discovery as ""colleagues and friends"" who often work with him to advance aerial imagery research, using drones just 30 metres above the water's surface. ""The use of drones has revolutionized everything,"" he explained. ""It supplies us with very high-resolution photographs.... One can see the edges of the whales pretty well and measure their total length and shape ... and of course we can detect pregnancies fairly early."" WATCH | Orca that carried stillborn baby for 2 weeks gives birth again: Orca that carried dead calf for 2 weeks gives birth again 2:04 The southern resident killer whale that carried its dead calf for more than two weeks in 2018 recently gave birth and has been spotted with the baby swimming healthily alongside it. 2:04 Southern resident orcas are listed as ""endangered"" by the Canadian and U.S. governments, as their salmon food sources dwindle and shipping traffic creates noise and often-deadly animal collisions. Southern resident killer whales are distinct from northern resident populations, as well as transient orcas. 'The decline is expected to continue' In June, the federal government issued an interim order for the protection of southern resident orcas, boosting existing regulations impacting shipping traffic in B.C. waters where the species is known to travel. ""The population is small and declining, and the decline is expected to continue,"" the federal government states in its species profile of the orcas. ""There are forecasts of continued low abundance of Chinook Salmon. Southern residents are also threatened by increasing physical and acoustical disturbance, oil spills and contaminants."" Noise pollution along busy shipping routes impedes the orcas' use of echo-location to hunt as well as their communication within their pod. Barrett-Lennard described the situation as ""death by a thousand cuts."" The two Washington researchers involved in the study, as well as the U.S. government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, could not be reached by time of publication. ""The southern residents are iconic for us,"" McInnes said, ""and we're really hoping that there's some survival for the new calves ahead."""

The same region including eastern Europe is now facing another intrusion of the very cold air mass. A powerful cold outbreak will intensify in the coming days, while gradually spreading towards the Balkan peninsula, the Black Sea region, and Turkey. After a number of intense and deadly heatwaves this past meteorological summer, many countries were under the gun of extreme, locally historic heat that were replaced by a quick change into much colder period from the end of August into early September. It was a significant change from extremely hot days to mid-autumn temperatures in just few days. We are now heading into the final 10 days of September 2021, temperatures are generally lower with less Sun heating and occasional intrusions of colder air mass from the north. Just this week, a pretty powerful cold outbreak is forecast to impact eastern and southeastern Europe, with a much colder air mass than normal. The water vapor satellite image this Monday has revealed a classic pattern that is normally resulting in a cold intrusion into continental Europe. A large upper-level low is placed over far eastern Europe and western Russia, with blocking High over western Europe. In between the two, meridional northerly flow is establishing from Scandinavia across Poland towards Ukraine. Notice also a pretty deep and well-defined cyclonic feature over far North Atlantic, that is a deep extratropical storm moving across Iceland today. Most of the countries from the Baltic region to the eastern part of central Europe, the whole Balkan peninsula, eastern Europe, as well as the Black Sea region and Turkey will experience well-below normal temperatures for this late September period. The attached video below hints at the significant cold outbreak advancing towards the south. Temperatures will be pretty *much* lower than normal for late September in these areas, especially across Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, and Turkey in the coming days. Very likely close to 15 °C below the average, also rising the potential for some frosty mornings in the most exposed lowland areas. Chilly daytime temperatures are expected as northerlies will also come with the cold behind the strong front. BLOCKING ON THE WEST, DEEP LOW OVER EASTERN EUROPE The general weather pattern over the European continent and North Atlantic early this week reveals a strong blocking high, centered over western Europe. To its east, a large and deep upper low is established, with its core deepening while gradually moving south. On Tuesday, the position of both large-scale features results in a strong advection of meridional northerly flow from Scandinavia into Eastern Europe, meaning the cold advection will intensify. With the deepening upper low, the cold outbreak develops and spreads further south towards the Balkan peninsula and the Black Sea region. The temperatures will be significantly lower than normal, about 12-15 °C below normal across eastern Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova on Tuesday. Thanks to a strong surface frontal system associated with this low, the cold air mass intrusion will continue further south-southeast behind the main cold front. While warmth will remain under the west European ridge, a much colder air mass will accumulate over the eastern half of the continent and persist for days. A deep extratropical low will move across Iceland on Tuesday, also resulting in warmer air mass spread into Scandinavia. But the weather pattern change that is forecast this week will bring a pretty significant refreshment also for the Balkan peninsula and especially around the Black Sea region. Temperatures on Wednesday will bring the cold across much of the peninsula, spreading towards Turkey through mid-week. POWERFUL COLD OUTBREAK TO SPREAD INTO BLACK SEA REGION AND TURKEY The large upper low will further deepen on Wedneday, releasing a significant cold pool spread across much of the eastern half of Europe. The 850 mbar temperature anomaly chart below reveals how large the cold pool is forecast, covering the whole Balkan peninsula, eastern Europe, and the Black Sea, as well as Baltic countries. Such strength of the upper low and an associated cold advection normally lasts for days, so the significant cold outbreak is forecast to continue farther south until Friday. The low will deepen a lot and become elongated on Thursday, centered over southeastern Europe. While the strong upper-level ridge over western Europe will gradually vanish through mid-week, moving west with its core. To its north, deep secondary low in the wake of a large depression over the Arctic region develops towards Scotland. On Thursday, the large cold pool reaches Turkey with temperatures much lower compared to the early days this week. Daytime temperature will be 12-15 °C lower than normal for this period in September, and even more than 20 °C lower than on Monday and Tuesday. The Balkan peninsula will not be spared from the cold either, at least across the eastern parts. The chart on the left is the 850 mbar anomaly (approximately 1500 m ASL), 2m anomaly is seen on the right. Pretty wild temperature anomaly over Turkey! How powerful the cold outbreak will be is best visible on the anomaly charts. Here is the GFS Meteogram chart for the city of Istanbul, Turkey over the next 14 days. While the 850 mbar temperature on Tuesday will be around 18 °C (about 6 degrees CC above normal), the cooldown that follows will be huge. The temperature on this level will drop significantly on Wednesday and peak on Thursday into Friday, going down almost 10 degrees Celsius below normal. So the temperature change will be nearly 15 °C in about a 36-48 hours period. Attached below is an interesting chart with the comparison of afternoon temperatures across Turkey between Wednesday and Friday. Quite a difference as daytime temperatures will be even more than 20 °C lower in a matter of two days. The strongest temperature difference will be pronounced particularly across the central and eastern parts of Turkey. WEATHER PATTERN FLIP OVER THE WEEKEND, RETURNS THE WARMTH INTO EASTERN EUROPE Late this week, the general weather pattern across Europe will proceed into some changes. The large and deep upper low across eastern and southeastern Europe will finally weaken, diminishing the intense cold outbreak over the Black Sea region. With a persistent deep trough over the North Atlantic and northern Europe, ridging from the west-southwest Europe will gradually expand into central Europe and further east. This will allow higher geopotential falls to develop also over the Balkan peninsula, as well as eastern Europe and the Black Sea region. The result will be much stable weather and especially higher temperatures. As we could see from the Istanbul Meteogram chart above, warmth will be quite significant and temperatures are forecast to climb a few degrees above normal again. Overall, the southwesterly flow will allow warmth to spread across southern, and eastern Europe, including Scandinavia and the Baltic region. Temperatures should again return into the mid-20s for many countries over the weekend and extend into the final week of September 2021. ***Images used in this article were provided by Windy and Wetterzentrale.

Biden, who will make his first speech to the world body as the American leader on Tuesday, was represented by his climate envoy John Kerry at the meeting convened by Britain and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Ahead of the Paris agreement, developed countries pledged to mobilize $100 billion a year from 2020 to support poorer nations with climate adaptation, but there is currently around a $20 billion shortfall. Photo: POOL / John Minchillo ""We did hear from the US representative in the room that... some good news was imminent,"" the UN official said, adding there were ""really positive views and signals coming from the US representative."" ""We don't have the details, of course, but hopefully it will help to provide that clarity on how the US intends to step up to support the mobilization of the $100 billion."" The announcement was a sliver of hope on the climate front following a slew of recent scientific reports painting a bleak picture of the planet's future, as the world's top polluters continue to spew greenhouse gases at alarming rates. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who co-hosted the meeting, took leaders to task over their failure to honor their pledges for the fund, which is meant to deliver $100 billion every year from 2020 to 2025. Photo: POOL / John Minchillo ""Everyone nods and we all agree that 'something must be done,'"" said Johnson, whose country will host the all-critical COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. ""Yet I confess I'm increasingly frustrated that the something to which many of you have committed is nowhere near enough,"" he added, in remarks shared by his office. Last week, the OECD confirmed that only $79.6 billion was mobilized in 2019. ""We heard from some of the industrialized countries... the faint signs of progress,"" Johnson told reporters after the meeting, mentioning Sweden and Denmark. Photo: AFP / SAUL LOEB Both countries have announced they would allocate 50 percent or more of their climate financing for adaptation in the developing world, another key UN goal. ""Let's see what the president of the United States has to say tomorrow,"" he added, hinting at the news to come. Britain for its part trumpeted its $15 billion climate finance pledges over the next five years, and announced Monday that $750 million of that would be allocated to supporting developing countries to meet net zero targets and end the use of coal. ""We're the guys who created the problem -- the industrial revolution started more or less in our country,"" said Johnson. ""So of course I understand the feelings of injustice in the developing world... But I say to them, that's why we've got to get the funding to help you to make the progress that you need."" The meeting came days after Guterres warned the world was on a ""catastrophic"" path to 2.7 degrees Celsius heating, after the latest bombshell report by UN scientists unveiled last week. The figure would shatter the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement, which aimed for warming well below 2C and preferably capped at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Guterres told reporters he called the conference with Johnson as ""a wake-up call to instill a sense of urgency on the dire state of the climate process ahead of COP26."" The Paris agreement calls for net zero emissions by 2050, with strong reductions by 2030, to meet the 1.5C goal. With only 1.1C of warming so far, the world has seen a torrent of deadly weather disasters intensified by climate change in recent months, from asphalt-melting heat waves to flash floods and untamable wildfires."

The changes, to take effect in November, will allow families and others who have been separated by the travel restrictions for 18 months to plan for long-awaited reunifications and allow foreigners with work permits to get back to their jobs in the U.S. Our redesigned local news and weather app is live! Download it for iOS or Android — and sign up for alerts. Airlines, business groups and travelers cheered. “It’s a happy day. Big Apple, here I come!” said French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton, 45, finally able to book a trip to New York City that had been put on hold over the virus restrictions. The new policy will replace a patchwork of travel bans first instituted by President Donald Trump last year and tightened by President Joe Biden that restrict travel by non-citizens who have in the prior 14 days been in the United Kingdom, European Union, China, India, Iran, Republic of Ireland, Brazil or South Africa. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients announced the new policies, which still will require all foreign travelers flying to the U.S. to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of flight. Biden will also tighten testing rules for unvaccinated American citizens, who will need to be tested within a day before returning to the U.S., as well as after they arrive home. Fully vaccinated passengers will not be required to quarantine, Zients said. There will be no immediate change to U.S. land border policies, which restrict much cross-border travel with Mexico and Canada. The travel bans had become the source of growing geopolitical frustration, particularly among allies in the UK and EU. The easing comes ahead of Biden meeting with some European leaders on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly this week. “This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it’s a stronger system,"" Zients said. The EU and UK had previously moved to allow vaccinated U.S. travelers in without quarantines, in an effort to boost business and tourism. But the EU recommended last month that some travel restrictions be reimposed on U.S. travelers to the bloc because of the rampant spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus in America. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will require airlines to collect contact information from international travelers to facilitate tracing, Zients said. It was not immediately clear which vaccines would be acceptable under the U.S. system and whether those unapproved in the U.S. could be used. Zients said that decision would be up to the CDC. If you have a big trip coming up, you may be wondering whether or not it’s worth purchasing travel insurance. The answer is: it depends. Here’s what you need to know before you decide to buy basic coverage, comprehensive insurance, or no travel insurance at all. Monday's announcement was met with applause by the air travel industry, which has lost significant revenue from declines in international travel. Delta Air Lines spokesman Morgan Durrant said, ""Science tells us that vaccinations coupled with testing is the safest way to re-open travel, and we are optimistic this important decision will allow for the continued economic recovery both in the U.S. and abroad and the reunification of families who have been separated for more than 18 months.” Worldwide, air travel is still down more than half from pre-pandemic levels, and the decline is much sharper for cross-border flying. By July, domestic travel had recovered to 84% of 2019 numbers, but international travel was just 26% of the same month two years ago, according to figures this month from the airline industry’s main global trade group, the International Air Transport Association. The numbers are similar but not quite as stark for the U.S., where international travel in August was 46% of that in August 2019, according to Airlines for America. Arrivals by non-U.S. citizens were only 36% of the 2019 level. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was “delighted” by the news. He said: “It’s a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again.” Airlines hailed the U.S. decision as a lifeline for the struggling industry. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines U.K. said it was “a major breakthrough.” Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said it was “a major milestone. ... The U.K. will now be able to strengthen ties with our most important economic partner, the U.S., boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues."" The changes also drew praise from business groups, who have been contending with labor shortages as the economy bounces back with unexpected strength from last year’s coronavirus recession. U.S. employers have been posting job openings — a record 10.9 million in July — faster than applicants can fill them. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the U..S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, “Allowing vaccinated foreign nationals to travel freely to the United States will help foster a robust and durable recovery for the American economy.” — AP writers Jill Lawless in London, Thomas Adamson-Koumbouzis in Paris and David Koenig in Dallas contributed."

(UGC via AP) NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — In parts of Ethiopia’s Tigray region, people now eat only green leaves for days. At a health center last week, a mother and her newborn weighing just 1.7 pounds died from hunger. In every district of the more than 20 where one aid group works, residents have starved to death. For months, the United Nations has warned of famine in this embattled corner of northern Ethiopia, calling it the world’s worst hunger crisis in a decade. Now internal documents and witness accounts reveal the first starvation deaths since Ethiopia’s government in June imposed what the U.N. calls “a de facto humanitarian aid blockade.” Forced starvation is the latest chapter in a conflict where ethnic Tigrayans have been massacred, gang-raped and expelled. Months after crops were burned and communities stripped bare, a new kind of death has set in. “You are killing people,” Hayelom Kebede, the former director of Tigray’s flagship Ayder Referral Hospital, recalled telling Ethiopia’s health ministry in a phone call this month. “They said, ‘Yeah, OK, we’ll forward it to the prime minister.’ What can I do? I just cry.” He shared with The Associated Press photos of some of the 50 children receiving “very intensive care” because of malnutrition, the first such images to emerge from Tigray in months. In one, a small child with startled-looking eyes stares straight into the camera, a feeding tube in his nose, a protective amulet lying in the pronounced hollow of his throat. Medicines have almost run out, and hospital staffers haven’t been paid since June, Hayelom said. Conditions elsewhere for Tigray’s 6 million people are often worse. The blockade and the starvation that comes with it mark a new phase in the 10-month war between Tigray forces and the Ethiopian government, along with its allies. Now the United States has issued an ultimatum: Take steps to stop the fighting and let aid flow freely, or a new wave of sanctions could come within weeks. “The United States is appalled by reports of starvation deaths in Ethiopia,” a State Department spokesperson told the AP, calling the government’s denial of basic needs “indications of a siege.” The spokesperson called for the immediate restoration of “vital services” to Tigray. The war began as a political dispute between the prime minister, 2019 Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed, and the Tigrayans who had long dominated Ethiopia’s repressive national government. Since November, witnesses have said, Ethiopian forces and those from neighboring Eritrea looted food sources and destroyed health centers. In June, the Tigray fighters retook the region, and Ethiopia’s government declared a ceasefire, citing humanitarian grounds. Instead, the government has sealed off the region tighter than ever, fearing that aid will reach the Tigray forces. More than 350,000 metric tons of food aid are positioned in Ethiopia, but very little of it can get into Tigray. The government is so wary that humanitarian workers boarding rare flights to the region have been given an unusual list of items they cannot bring: Dental flossers. Can openers. Multivitamins. Medicines, even personal ones. The list, obtained by the AP, also banned means of documenting the crisis, including hard drives and flash drives. Photos and video from Tigray have disappeared from social media since June as aid workers and others, facing intense searches by authorities, fear being caught with them on their devices. Tigray has returned to darkness, with no telecommunications, no internet, no banking services and very little aid. Ethiopia’s prime minister and other senior officials have denied there is hunger in Tigray. The government has blamed the Tigray forces and insecurity for troubles with aid delivery. It also has accused humanitarian groups of supporting, even arming, the Tigray fighters. The prime minister’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, did not say when the government would allow basic services to the region. The government “has opened access to aid routes by cutting the number of checkpoints from seven to two and creating air bridges for humanitarian flights,” she said in a statement. But medical supplies on the first European Union air bridge flight were removed during government inspection, and such flights cannot carry the large-scale food aid needed. In the most extensive account yet of the blockade’s toll, a humanitarian worker told the AP that deaths from starvation are being reported in “every single” district of the more than 20 in Tigray where one aid group operates. The group had run out of food aid and fuel. The worker, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “Currently, there are devastating reports coming from every corner,” the aid group wrote to a donor in August, according to documents shared with the AP. “If no urgent solution is found, we will lose many people due to hunger.” In April, even before the current blockade was imposed, the same group wrote to the donor that “reports of malnourishment are rampant,” and that 22 people in one sub-district had starved to death. “People’s skin color was beginning to change due to hunger; they looked emaciated with protruding skeletal bones,” the aid group wrote. In August, another staffer visited a community in central Tigray and wrote that the number of people at risk of starvation was “exponentially increasing” in both rural and urban areas. In some cases, “people are eating only green leaves for days.” The staffer described speaking with one mother who said her family had been living on borrowed food since June. For the past month, they had eaten only bread with salt. She worried that without food aid in the coming days they would die. “Finally, we stopped asking her because we could not tolerate to hear additional grim news,” the staffer wrote. “The administrator of the (sub-district) has also told us that there are many families who are living in similar conditions.” At least 150 people starved to death in August, including in camps for displaced people, the Tigray External Affairs Office has alleged. The International Organization for Migration, the U.N. agency which supports the camps, said: “We unfortunately are not able to speak on this topic.” Some toilets in the crowded camps are overflowing because there’s no cash to pay for their cleaning, leaving thousands of people vulnerable to outbreaks of disease, a visiting aid worker said. People who ate three meals a day now eat only one. Camp residents rely on the charity of host communities who often struggle to feed themselves. “People have been able to get by, but barely,” the aid worker said. “It’s worse than subsistence, let’s put it that way.” Full Coverage: Ethiopia Erasing Ethnicity Food security experts months ago estimated that 400,000 people in Tigray face famine conditions, more than the rest of the world combined. But the blockade means experts cannot collect the needed data to make a formal declaration of famine. Such a declaration would be deeply embarrassing for Ethiopia, which in the 1980s seized the world’s attention with a famine so severe, also driven by conflict and government neglect, that some 1 million people were killed. Since then, Africa’s second most populous country had become a success story by pulling millions from extreme poverty and developing one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Now the war is hollowing out the economy, and stomachs. Malnutrition rates are near 30% for children under the age of 5, the U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday, and near 80% for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As the war spreads, so might hunger. Tigray forces have entered the neighboring regions of Amhara and Afar in recent weeks, and some residents accuse them of carrying out acts of retaliation, including closing off supply routes. The Tigray forces deny it, saying they aim to pressure Ethiopia’s government to lift the blockade. The U.N. human rights office says abuses have been committed by all sides, although to date witness accounts indicate the most widespread atrocities have been against Tigrayan civilians. There is little help coming. The U.N. says at least 100 trucks with food and other supplies must reach Tigray every day to meet people’s needs. But as of Sept. 8, fewer than 500 had arrived since July on the only accessible road into the region. No medical supplies or fuel have been delivered to Tigray in more than a month, the U.S. says, blaming “government harassment” and decisions, not the fighting. In mid-September the U.N. issued the first report of its kind showing in red the number of days remaining before cash or fuel ran out for key humanitarian work like treating Tigray’s most severely malnourished. Often, that number was zero. Some trucks carrying aid have been attacked, and drivers intimidated. In August, a U.N. team trying to pick up staff from Tigray was turned around by armed police who “ordered the drivers to drive significantly over speed limits while verbally abusing, harassing and threatening them,” a U.N. report said. Major international aid groups like Doctors Without Borders and the Norwegian Refugee Council have had their operations suspended, accused of spreading “misinformation” about the war. Almost two dozen aid workers have been killed, some while distributing food. Some aid workers are forced to ration their own food. “It is a day-to-day reality to see human sufferings, starvation,” the Catholic bishop of Adigrat, Abune Tesfaselassie Medhin, wrote in a Sept. 3 letter, shared with the AP, appealing to partners overseas for help and warning of catastrophe ahead. The need for food will continue well into next year, the U.N. says, because the limited crops planted amid the fighting are likely to produce only between a quarter and at most half of the usual harvest. Grim as they are, the reports of starvation deaths reflect only areas in Tigray that can be reached. One Tigrayan humanitarian worker pointed out that most people live or shelter in remote places such as rugged mountains. Others are in inaccessible areas bordering hostile Eritrea or in western Tigray, now controlled by authorities from the Amhara region who bar the way to neighboring Sudan, a potential route for delivering aid. As food and the means to find it run out, the humanitarian worker said, “I am sure the people that are dying out of this man-made hunger are way more than this.” ___ ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Ethiopia coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/ethiopia-erasing-ethnicity"
6278,"ps9rfc","Justin Trudeau to remain Prime Minister of Canada","https://www.cp24.com/news/liberals-to-win-most-seats-in-federal-election-projection-1.5592142",26499,"cp","Justin Trudeau's Liberals win third term but fall short of securing majority","2021-09-20 05:07:00-05"," Joan Bryden, The Canadian Press   OTTAWA - Canadians have chosen another minority Liberal government - almost identical to the one it replaced - to finish the fight against COVID-19 and rebuild the shattered economy. Precisely how stable a minority remains to be seen, as results were still trickling in and there were tight contests in dozens of ridings as the clock started running out on Monday night. There are also almost 800,000 mail-in ballots to be counted, starting Tuesday, which could yet change the preliminary results in many of those tightly contested seats. Late Monday, Justin Trudeau's Liberals were leading or elected in 156 seats - one less than they won in 2019 and 14 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the House of Commons. Erin O'Toole's Conservatives were leading or elected in 121 seats, the same as in 2019 even though they won slightly more of the popular vote than the Liberals, as they did last time. Jagmeet Singh's NDP were leading or elected in 27, a gain of three seats, while Yves-Francois Blanchet's Bloc Quebecois remained unchanged with 32 seats. The Greens, which elected three MPs in 2019, were down to two. Leader Annamie Paul, who had faced an internal insurrection last spring, was projected to come in fourth place in Toronto Centre in her third try to wrest that seat from the Liberals. Maxime Bernier's People's Party, which ran on an anti-public health restrictions platform, didn't come close to winning a seat anywhere but pulled enough votes from the Conservatives to rob them of victory in a number of close races, particularly in Ontario. The upshot raises questions about the judgment and strategy of both Trudeau and O'Toole. Trudeau pulled the plug on his minority Liberal government on Aug. 15, a little less than two years after Canadians first reduced the Liberals to a minority. He argued that Canada was at a pivotal moment in history and Canadians deserved a chance to decide how they wanted to proceed through the rest of the pandemic and beyond. But the timing of his election call, coming as a fourth wave of the novel coronavirus was beginning to sweep the country, quickly sapped the goodwill Trudeau had built among Canadians for his government's handling of the pandemic over the previous 18 months. And it gave rival leaders an opening to attack Trudeau's character, describing him as a selfish egoist who can't be trusted to put the interests of Canadians ahead of his personal ambition to secure a majority. The 36-day campaign also exacerbated divisions in the country over the approach to mandatory vaccinations and vaccine passports, sparking ugly protests by profanity spewing opponents of public health restrictions, including one incident in which gravel was thrown at Trudeau and his entourage. O'Toole won his party's leadership last year by courting social conservatives but then ditched his “true blue” image in a bid to broaden his party's appeal outside its Western Canada base. He presented himself to voters as a moderate with pricey centrist policies, including a plan to put a price on carbon, which his party had previously pilloried as a job-killing tax on everything. But the move did not produce the hoped-for breakthrough for the Conservatives in Ontario or Quebec, where the Liberals once again won the lion's share of the seats, and helped push some right-wing voters into the arms of the People's Party. In a speech to supporters after the outcome O'Toole doubled down on his centrist approach and, in an apparent bid to head off any move to oust him as leader, signalled that he's not going anywhere. Predicting that Trudeau will plunge the country into another election in 18 months in yet another bid to secure a majority, O'Toole said he's “resolutely committed to continuing this journey for Canada.” He said he'd congratulated Trudeau on the election victory but also told him, “If he thinks he can threaten Canadians with another election in 18 months, the Conservative party will be ready and, whenever that day comes, I will be ready to lead Canada's Conservatives to victory.” The NDP, which had hoped to ride on Singh's status as the most popular federal leader, did not make the number of gains it had hoped for either. It lost its lone Atlantic seat and was down one to just five in Ontario. It did pick up one seat in Quebec, where it now holds just two of 78 seats, and gained one in Alberta. As before, Trudeau will need the support of at least one opposition party to pass any legislation and survive crucial confidence votes. Both Singh and Blanchet indicated that they will push their priorities in exchange for supporting the Liberal government. For Singh, that includes making the “super wealthy” pay their fair share of taxes. Blanchet said the Bloc Quebecois will support the minority government on issues and legislation that it deems to be in Quebec's best interests but oppose it if Quebec's interests are not served. For her part, Paul admitted she was disappointed to lose her bid for a seat but celebrated the re-election of former Green leader Elizabeth May and a gain by Green candidate Mike Morrice in Kitchener Centre, where the Liberal incumbent, Raj Saini, was dumped by his party mid-campaign over sexual harassment allegations. She did not mention whether she'll try to carry on as leader. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 20, 2021."

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks to media at a press conference, during the High-Level Ministerial Event on the Humanitarian Situation in Afghanistan, at the European headquarters of the United Nation, in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday, Sept. 13, 2021. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP) U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres talks to media at a press conference, during the High-Level Ministerial Event on the Humanitarian Situation in Afghanistan, at the European headquarters of the United Nation, in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday, Sept. 13, 2021. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP) UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Warning of a potential new Cold War, the head of the United Nations implored China and the United States to repair their “completely dysfunctional” relationship before problems between the two large and deeply influential countries spill over even further into the rest of the planet. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to The Associated Press this weekend ahead of this week’s annual United Nations gathering of world leaders — a convening blemished by COVID, climate concerns and contentiousness across the planet. Guterres said the world’s two major economic powers should be cooperating on climate and negotiating more robustly on trade and technology even given persisting political fissures about human rights, economics, online security and sovereignty in the South China Sea. “Unfortunately, today we only have confrontation,” Guterres said Saturday in the AP interview. ADVERTISEMENT “We need to re-establish a functional relationship between the two powers,” he said, calling that “essential to address the problems of vaccination, the problems of climate change and many other global challenges that cannot be solved without constructive relations within the international community and mainly among the superpowers.” Two years ago, Guterres warned global leaders of the risk of the world splitting in two, with the United States and China creating rival internets, currency, trade, financial rules “and their own zero-sum geopolitical and military strategies.” He reiterated that warning in the AP interview, adding that two rival geopolitical and military strategies would pose “dangers” and divide the world. Thus, he said, the foundering relationship must be repaired — and soon. “We need to avoid at all cost a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage,” Guterres said. The so-called Cold War between the Soviet Union and its East bloc allies and the United States and its Western allies began immediately after World War II and ended with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. It was a clash of two nuclear-armed superpowers with rival ideologies — communism and authoritarianism on one side, capitalism and democracy on the other. The U.N. chief said a new Cold War could be more perilous because the Soviet-U.S. antipathy created clear rules, and both sides were conscious of the risk of nuclear destruction. That produced back channels and forums “to guarantee that things would not get out of control,” he said. “Now, today, everything is more fluid, and even the experience that existed in the past to manage crisis is no longer there,” Guterres said. He said the U.S.-Britain deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines so it could operate undetected in Asia “is just one small piece of a more complex puzzle ... this completely dysfunctional relationship between China and the United States.” The secretly negotiated deal angered China and France, which had signed a contract with Australia worth at least $66 billion for a dozen French conventional diesel-electric submarines. ADVERTISEMENT The White House gently pushed back against Gutterres’ critique on Monday. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration disagrees with Gutterres’ characterization of the U.S.-China relationship. “Our relationship with China is one not of conflict but of competition,” Psaki said. She added: “He is not looking to pursue a new Cold War with any country in the world.” Biden, in his address before the General Assembly on Tuesday, will underscore that he doesn’t believe in “the notion of a new Cold War” in which the world divided into blocs, according to a senior administration official. That official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview Biden’s speech, said Biden will make the case that vigorous competition between the two nations is possible without tipping into conflict. In the wide-ranging AP interview, Guterres also addressed three major issues that world leaders will be confronting this week: the worsening climate crisis, the still-raging pandemic and Afghanistan’s uncertain future under its new Taliban rulers. They took power Aug. 15 without a fight from the government’s U.S.-trained army as American forces were in the final stage of withdrawing from the country after 20 years. What role will the United Nations have in the new Afghanistan? Guterres called it “a fantasy” to believe that U.N. involvement “will be able all of a sudden to produce an inclusive government, to guarantee that all human rights are respected, to guarantee that no terrorists will ever exist in Afghanistan, that drug trafficking will stop.” After all, he said, the United States and many other countries had thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and spent trillions of dollars and weren’t able to solve the country’s problems — and, some say, made them worse. Though the United Nations has “limited capacity and limited leverage,” he said, it is playing a key role in leading efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Afghans. The U.N. is also drawing the Taliban’s attention to the importance of an inclusive government that respects human rights, especially for women and girls, he said. “There is clearly a fight for power within different groups in the Taliban leadership. The situation is not yet clarified,” he said, calling it one more reason why the international community should engage with the Taliban. While former U.S. president Donald Trump was wedded to an “America First” policy, President Joe Biden — who will make his first appearance as chief executive at the General Assembly’s high-level meeting Tuesday — has reaffirmed U.S. commitment to multilateral institutions. Guterres said Biden’s commitment to global action on climate, including rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement that Trump withdrew from, is “probably the most important of them all.” He said there is “a completely different environment in the relationship” between the United Nations and the United States under Biden. But, Guterres said, “I did everything — and I’m proud of it — in order to make sure that we would keep a functional relationship with the United States in the past administration.” Guterres also lamented the failure of countries to work together to tackle global warming and ensure that people in every country are vaccinated. Of the past year of COVID-19 struggles, he said: “We were not able to make any real progress in relation to effective coordination of global efforts.” And of climate: “One year ago, we were seeing a more clear movement in the right direction, and that movement has slowed down in the recent past . So we need to re-accelerate again if we are not going into disaster.” Guterres called it “totally unacceptable” that 80% of the population in his native Portugal has been vaccinated while in many African countries, less than 2% of the population is vaccinated. “It’s completely stupid from the point of view of defeating the virus, but if the virus goes on spreading like wildfire in the global south, there will be more mutations,” he said. “And we know that mutations are making it more transmissible, more dangerous.” He again urged the world’s 20 major economic powers in the G20, who failed to take united action against COVID-19 in early 2020, to create the conditions for a global vaccination plan. Such a plan, he said, must bring together vaccine-producing countries with international financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies to double production and ensure equitable distribution. “I think this is possible,” Guterres said. “It depends on political will.” The secretary-general said rich, developed countries are spending about 20% of their GDP on recovery problems, middle income countries about 6% and the least developed countries 2% of a small GDP. That, he says, has produced frustration and mistrust in parts of the developing world that have received neither vaccines nor recovery assistance. The divide between developed countries in the north and developing countries in the south “is very dangerous for global security,” Guterres said, “and it’s very dangerous for the capacity to bring the world together to fight climate change.” ___ Associated Press journalist Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.

New figures from the Australian Koala Foundation - which has been monitoring koala numbers for about a decade - reveal populations have plunged by 30 per cent in just three years. The most recent population estimate is that the country is home to between 32,000 and 58,000 koalas, down from between 46,000 and 82,000 in 2018. That's just a fraction of the eight million koalas in Australia when European settlement began. Adelaide wildlife rescuer Simon Adamczyk is seen with koala rescued at a burning forest near near Cape Borda on Kangaroo Island (pictured) southwest of Adelaide on January 7, 2020 The furry marsupial's numbers have plunged in every federal electorate but most noticeably in those in Queensland where just 6,500 could be left in the entire state. 'There used to be five electorates with more than 5000 animals and now there's only two and it's shocking that it's happened in just three years,' the non-profit's chair Deborah Tabart told news.com.au. The animals are found in the southeast part of Australia from mid-north Queensland through NSW, Victoria and to South Australia. The data shows the animals are now extinct in the Riverina electorate - directly in the centre of the koalas habitat, while South Australia is estimated to have under a thousand of the animals. The Australian Koala Foundation said numbers of the marsupials in the Australian wild have plunged by 30 per cent in just three years The numbers show the koala is now extinct in 47 electorates and only one, in the South Australian electorate of Mayo, has more than 5000 koalas. Flinders University's Professor of ecology Corey Bradshaw said the situation for the species is dire. 'When they go extinct is up for debate, but whether they will go extinct is not really up for debate anymore.' Professor Bradshaw said. 'Habitats have been cleared... fragmented by roads and development. [There's] genetic problems and diseases... dogs and cars. Add bushfires, and there's not a lot of long term hope for that species in particular,' he said. Land clearing and bushfires are widespread threats to the marsupials' habitat (pictured: a bushfire rips the the Australian landscape in February 2021) Currently the animals are listed as 'vulnerable' under the Australian Government's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in Queensland and NSW. The Australian Koala Foundation wants Victoria and South Australia included, the listing upgraded to 'critically endangered' and separate legislation to protect the Australian icon. 'We need a Koala Protection Act now,' Ms Tabart said."

The row erupted over Kosovo's use of plates with RKS (Republic of Kosovo) on them, which implies its status as an independent nation, something bitterly disputed by Serbia. Until now, vehicles with Serbian registration plates have been entering Kosovo freely. But since Serbia refuses to allow cars with RKS plates, demanding that they take temporary plates on arrival, Pristina says its ban is just a reciprocal measure. Protesters used trucks and cars to completely shut down traffic on the roads towards the Jarinje and Brnjak crossings, an AFP journalist noted. They also set up tents, saying they would spend the night on the barricades. The Kosovo government on Sunday sent armoured vehicles and a special police unit to the mainly ethnic-Serb area to monitor the implementation of the ban. ""Pristina demonstrates force and nothing else,"" one of about 500 protesters gathered near the Jarinje crossing told AFP. The police ""will have to leave, if not, it won't be good,"" said the protester who requested to remain anonymous. ""They have no business being in the north."" - US calls for restraint - ""It was not our wish but imposed by the other side,"" Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti told lawmakers Monday. Drivers entering Kosovo from Serbia with Serbian registration plates will have to take temporary ones as long as the same rule applies to Kosovo nationals with RKS plates entering Serbia, he added. Goran Rakic, the only Serb minister in the Kosovo government, joined the protesters on Monday, calling on Pristina to ""quit provocations"". Serbs expected Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to ""react and help us, as he has always done so far"", he added. Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the measure would apply as long as Serbia applied the same rule to Kosovar cars entering its territory - AFP Vucic said he would call for help from NATO if Pristina continued to ""endanger Serb property and lives"". He had called a meeting of security officials for Tuesday do discuss the situation in Kosovo, he added. ""I hope we won't be forced to implement our own measures, both economic and political ones,"" Vucic told a televised press conference. The US embassy called on both Kosovo and Serbia to ""exercise restraint, refrain from further unilateral actions, and reduce tensions -- immediately, without delay"", in a message posted on Twitter.

Videos circulating on social media showed people throwing belongings from windows of university buildings in the central city of Perm before jumping to flee the shooter. The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said several people were injured in the attack at Perm State National Research University and that the suspect, a student at the university, had been wounded while being detained. The committee initially put the death toll at eight but later revised it down to six. Police block the road near the scene after a gunman opened fire at the Perm State University in Perm, Russia, September 20, 2021. STRINGER/REUTERS State media broadcast amateur footage reportedly taken during the attack showing an individual dressed in black tactical clothing, including a helmet, carrying a weapon and walking through the campus. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the health ministry said 24 people were receiving treatment, including 19 who had received gunshot wounds. The health ministry declined to comment when reached by AFP. ""On September 20, a student, who was on the territory of one of the buildings of Perm State National Research University, opened fire on those around him,"" the Investigative Committee said in a statement. Students react as they gather outside the Perm State University in Perm, about 700 miles east of Moscow, Russia, September 20, 2021. AP School shootings are relatively unusual in Russia due to tight security at education facilities and because it is difficult to buy firearms legally, although it is possible to register hunting rifles. President Vladimir Putin had been notified of the shooting, the Kremlin said, adding that the health and science ministers had been ordered to travel to Perm to coordinate assistance for the victims. ""The president expresses sincere condolences to those who have lost family and loved ones as a result of this incident,"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Regional authorities said that classes at local schools, colleges and universities were cancelled on Monday. Russia's last deadly attack at an educational facility took place in May 2021, when a 19-year-old opened fire in his old school in the central city of Kazan, killing nine people. Investigators said that the gunman suffered from a brain disorder. But he was deemed fit to receive a license for the semi-automatic shotgun he used in the attack. On the day of that attack — one of the worst in recent Russian history — Putin called for a review of gun control laws. In November 2019, a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire at his college, killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting and killing himself. In October 2018, another teenage gunman killed 20 people at a Kerch technical college in Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. He was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the United States, which left 13 people dead. The Crimea shooter was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist. The country's FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years. The shooting took place as Russia was counting ballots following three-day parliamentary and local elections."

In an interview with the Guardian, Japan’s defence minister, Nobuo Kishi, said China had become increasingly powerful politically, economically and militarily and was “attempting to use its power to unilaterally change the status quo in the East and South China Seas”, which are crucial to global shipping and include waters and islands claimed by several other nations. Tokyo had “strong concerns in regards to the safety and security of not only our own country and the region but for the global community”, Kishi warned. “China is strengthening its military power both in terms of quantity and quality, and rapidly improving its operational capability,” he said. Kishi’s comments are a strong signal of the rising international concern over China’s military ambitions in disputed regions like the South and East China Sea, the Indian border, and in particular Taiwan. His remarks were echoed by senior figures on the island, with Taiwan’s former head of navy and deputy defence minister also warning that more deterrence was needed. With China ratcheting up military activity in the region, experts and global military figures have also warned that small confrontations or maritime accidents could quickly escalate into a full-blown conflict. The comments come amid fresh tensions over a new trilateral security partnership, under which the US and UK will give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. The alliance is widely understood to be aimed at countering China. Kishi, who spoke to the Guardian before the new security pact was revealed, said Japan had gained the understanding and cooperation of many countries, but far more was needed to counter Beijing. He said the European parliament, as well as the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, had shown interest in supporting “a free and open Indo-Pacific”, but “it is important for many countries to speak out about the situation, and this itself will become a deterrent”. According to figures released by Japan’s coast guard, the number of “incursions” by Chinese vessels into disputed areas has increased dramatically since 2012. Earlier this year Chinese vessels were seen near the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands for a record 157 days in a row, and Japan recently lodged formal protest over a flotilla of seven Chinese coast guard vessels – the largest since 2016 – patrolling the contiguous zone on 30 August. Japan has become significantly more vocal in recent months, calling for greater engagement with the US and other parties in resisting what they call Chinese expansionism. This week, the outgoing prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, travels to Washington to attend an in-person summit of Quad with the US, India and Australia. The US – which is a key player in the geopolitical situation – has increased its presence in the region, issuing warnings to China and pledging support to those targeted. The UK has also announced a permanent military presence in the Indo-Pacific and recently led a carrier strike group – including Britain’s largest warship and Dutch and US assets – to participate in joint exercises. An image released by the Japan coast guard of a Chinese vessel cruising near the Senkaku islands in August 2021. Photograph: Japan Coast Guard Handout/EPA In April, the EU jointly declared tensions in the South China Sea were threatening regional peace and stability, while French warships have participated in joint exercises with the US and Japan, and Germany recently sent a warship for the first time in two decades. A new Indo-Pacific strategy report last week showed China to be at the centre of EU concerns, but that the bloc was taking a cautious approach. The document warned regional tensions “may have a direct impact on European security and prosperity”, but urged “multifaceted engagement” with China. Kishi said he had met recently with several foreign counterparts, including the UK, and “shared that what is happening in the East China Sea and the South China Sea is not only a regional problem, but at the same time also a problem for the international community”. “I expressed that this is also something happening that is relevant to Europe.” ‘Slowly pushing the envelope’ Critics say it’s difficult to gauge exactly how much China is spending every year on defence as they question Beijing’s official figures. But estimates show it to be the world’s second highest spender – after the US – with a 2020 budget more than three times that of the UK, and four times the budgets of Germany, France, and Japan. It has increased the budget of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) annually for the past two decades, building up coastal infrastructure and other capabilities. Recent reports have also said China is constructing hundreds of missile silos in its interior deserts, and converting passenger ferries for military amphibious lift – a key defence capability in which analysts had until now said China was well behind. China says it pursues a military policy that is “defensive in nature”. “We develop military capacity out of self-defence purpose. We do not intend to and will not pose a threat to any country,” spokesperson Hua Chunying said. “[But] compared with 20, 10, or even five years ago, Beijing just has more tools – missiles, warplanes, aircraft carriers, etcetera,” said Carl Minzner, a senior fellow of China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “It makes it more possible for Chinese officials to attempt to slowly push the envelope and essentially seize space.” The PLA has increased military drills and intimidatory sorties into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, clashed with Indian troops in border regions, and amended coast guard law to justify weapon use against other vessels. It has ignored a 2016 ruling by The Hague that there is no legal basis to its South China Sea claims, and continued building artificial geographic structures, inflaming tensions with other claimants. Earlier this year it sent hundreds of fishing boats carrying alleged militia to Philippines-claimed islands. “These Chinese military trends, including the rapid strengthening, increasing activity and expansion of its operational capabilities, combined with the lack of transparency regarding its defence policy and military capabilities, have become a strong security concern for Japan, the region and the international community,” warned Kishi. The PLA and Chinese coastguard frequently enter the waters around the disputed Senkakus – or Diaoyu islands in Chinese – and into Japan’s air defence identification zone, prompting the immediate scrambling of Japanese jets. Kishi said Japan would take “all measures against airspace incursions in accordance with international law and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces Act”, and that the “incursions” around the Senkakus were “very regrettable” violations of international law which “must not be tolerated”. He declined to say what would prompt a tougher response from Japan. “We have frankly communicated our concerns to China, and will continue to conduct such communication as much as possible.” Beijing’s ‘core interest’ Frank communication doesn’t appear to be working, critics say. China has ratcheted up its grey zone tactics: coercive activities which deliberately don’t meet the threshold for an act of war, but serve to exhaust and intimidate the other party. Kishi warned that these acts pose the greatest risk of sparking a hot war. “It is generally acknowledged that grey zone activities have the risk of leading to a larger military conflict,” he said. “A calm yet robust stance is required in order to prevent such a situation.” Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in March. The Philippine coast guard believed the ships were manned by Chinese maritime militia personnel. Photograph: Philippine Coast Guard/Reuters Lowy Institute China analyst Natasha Kassam said China’s aggression was the key factor, and its destabilising actions – routinely met with US or Taiwan responses – increased the risk of an accident. “It feels much more tense now than one or two years ago,” she said. Adm Lee Hsi-ming, Taiwan’s former head of navy and deputy defence minister, said while the South and East China Seas and the Indian border were major Chinese concerns, Taiwan was of “core interest” to Beijing, as the final piece of Xi Jinping’s dream of national rejuvenation. Beijing has pledged to take Taiwan – which it claims as a Chinese province – by force if necessary. The government of Taiwan says it seeks no conflict. Its president, Tsai Ing-wen, said in 2020 that “we don’t need to declare ourselves an independent state. We are an independent country already.” The potential circumstances and timing is vociferously debated, but there is general consensus that the risk of a Chinese move on Taiwan is the highest in decades. In preparation, Taiwan has increased its weapons purchases from the US and lobbied for international alliances. It conducts annual military drills to practise skills that would be needed in the event of an attack by China. Lee, who advocates for Taiwan to improve its asymmetric self-defence system rather than buy big weapons, said allies like Japan and the US served primarily as deterrence rather than tactical support, but echoed comments by Kishi that more deterrence was needed. “There are two factors for war happening: capability and intention,” said Lee. “When they have both, we have a problem.” Much of Japan’s desire for more support from western allies can be linked to Taiwan’s fate. Japan’s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, told a fundraising event in July that a Chinese attack on Taiwan posed an existential risk to Japan, whose southern islands neighbour Taiwan’s northern tip. “China is rapidly strengthening its military power, and the military balance between China and Taiwan is on the whole shifting in favour of China, with the gap widening every year,” said Nishi. “It is possible that the situation will further intensify, and therefore a close watch must be kept.” Giulio Pugliese, a lecturer at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, said it was unrealistic to expect the EU to use finite military resources to balance China’s power in the region, and the sending of ships and aircraft and participation in drills was to “make a point”. Other collective efforts, such as joint statements, demonstrate “there’s a broad coalition of distant states with active stakes in regional stability and the preservation of the international law of the sea”, he said. Drew Thompson, a former US defence department official responsible for managing bilateral relations with China and Taiwan, said all governments should be asking themselves: “What are you doing to raise the cost to Beijing for pulling the trigger?”"

The flow of molten rock will not reach the Atlantic Ocean on Monday evening as earlier estimated, an official said. Experts say that if and when it does, it could trigger more explosions and clouds of toxic gases. ""The movement of lava is much slower than it was initially ... There has not been a large advance during the day,"" local emergency coordinator Miguel Angel Morcuende told a press briefing on Monday evening. He said the stream had made its way about halfway to the coast. A new stream of lava erupted from the volcano late on Monday, prompting the evacuation of residents in the town of El Paso, the regional emergency agency wrote on Twitter. The volcano first erupted on Sunday, shooting lava hundreds of metres into the air, engulfing forests and sending molten rock towards the ocean over a sparsely populated area of La Palma, the northwesternmost island in the Canaries archipelago. loading No fatalities or injuries have been reported but drone footage captured two tongues of black lava cutting a devastating swathe through the landscape as they advanced down the volcano's western flank towards the sea. A Reuters witness saw the flow of molten rock slowly tear its way through a house in the village of Los Campitos, igniting the interior and sending flames through the windows and onto the roof. Around 100 homes have been affected by the volcano's eruption, said regional emergency official Jorge Parra, adding that residents should not fear for their safety if they follow authorities' recommendations. Six roads on the island were closed, officials said. Regional leader Angel Victor Torres said the damage would be substantial. ""It is still active and will continue to be active for the next few days,"" he added. 1/9 A house burns due to lava from the eruption of a volcano in the Cumbre Vieja national park at Los Llanos de Aridane, on the Canary Island of La Palma, September 20, 2021.

Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said the eruption was ""a wonderful show"" which would attract more tourists to the tourism-dependent archipelago - comments that were criticised by the opposition at a time when many residents have lost their homes. Some of the tourists at the airport disagreed with Maroto. ""We want to leave as fast as possible,"" said Wienard, a 55-year- old social worker from Salzburg. But at least one visitor was happy. ""I felt like a little child inside, very excited,"" said Kabirly, 26, a market researcher from Belgium. ""It was also my birthday yesterday so it was sort of a candle on the island cake!"" About 360 tourists were evacuated from a resort in La Palma following the eruption and taken to the nearby island of Tenerife by boat early on Monday, a spokesperson for ferry operator Fred Olsen said. A total of more than 500 tourists had to leave their hotels. Anticipating reduced visibility, maritime authorities on Monday closed down shipping to the west of the island. La Palma had been on high alert after thousands of tremors were reported over a week in Cumbre Vieja, which belongs to a chain of volcanoes that last had a major eruption in 1971 and is one of the Canaries' most active volcanic regions. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited some affected areas and met officials on Monday, and later took to Twitter to praise the emergency personnel's response. Airspace around the Canaries has remained open with no visibility problems, the Enaire civil air authority said after a local airline cancelled four flights between islands.

Rusesabagina is a prominent opposition activist, calling for democracy in Rwanda. Rusesabagina has been a vocal critic of President Paul Kagame, who has now led Rwanda for more than 20 years. His arrest followed his calls for change — and his support for a group that is affiliated with a rebel group accused of carrying out violence. The court's finding comes after Rusesabagina withdrew from his trial in March, saying the proceedings were unfair and would not bring justice. Authorities deported his main attorney, Vincent Lurquin, earlier this year. Lurquin, who is Belgian, told the media that he hadn't been allowed to see his client. The activist was arrested in 2020 Rusesabagina was arrested under circumstances that have been described as both a kidnapping and a trick: He had been living abroad, aware of the reprisals he would likely face in Rwanda. But when he got on the plane that took him to Rwanda, he had apparently been told that he was going to Burundi at the invitation of a pastor. Rwandan authorities have been holding Rusesabagina in custody since his arrest. He initially appeared at trial wearing a pink prison uniform. Prosecutors are seeking a life prison term for Rusesabagina, according to the state-run Rwanda Broadcasting Agency. Rusesabagina rose to fame for helping Tutsis survive Rusesabagina, 67, is of Hutu and Tutsi descent. In 1994, with the Rwandan genocide putting all Tutsis under threat, Rusesabagina used his position as the manager of the Hôtel des Mille Collines to help more than 1,200 Tutsis and others survive. His actions were turned into a film, with Don Cheadle portraying Rusesabagina. Rusesabagina has embarked on international speaking tours since his story became well known.

The Langdon Firehouse Bar and Grill writes on Facebook that it has been flooded with angry comments and messages since it announced people would have to prove they’ve been vaccinated or share a negative COVID-19 test before entering the bar. “This past weekend we were overwhelmed with threats and bullying both in person and online. This was directed to the ownership group and the staff! We feel the safety of ourselves and our staff is at risk,” the bar said. The restaurant says all through the pandemic, it stayed in line with Alberta’s COVID-19 restrictions, closing when needed, making sure patrons were masked, and keeping parties socially distanced when they were dining in. “We have always tried to do what is right for the community, our staff, and this business. We have made very difficult decisions for the greater good of the community and our business,” the bar said. RELATED: “The beliefs that people have, have become more than just beliefs, they have become anger and hate. This has impacted us in a way we did not expect.” The bar has turned off comments and direct messages on its social media pages. It says it will be closing dine-in service and will only remain open in the evenings for pick-up and delivery orders.

Around 200 people gathered on Saturday in the gay-friendly neighborhood of Chueca, known as the center of Spain’s annual Pride celebrations, where they shouted insults such as “get fags out of our neighborhood” and “get those sidosos [AIDS-ridden people] out of Madrid,” as they marched toward the city’s landmark Puerta del Sol square. Prosecutors in Madrid have launched an investigation into potential hate crimes and have requested reports from the police and from the government delegation in the region. During the two-hour demonstration, the group set off flares, carried signs with far-right symbols and expressed their contempt for unaccompanied migrant minors and migrants more broadly. The participants – who were escorted by riot police and several National Police vans – also waved Spanish flags and symbols of Juventud Nacional (National Youth), an organization linked to the far-right party España 2000 (Spain 2000). Protesters from the homophobic march in Puerta del Sol. Olmo Calvo As well as the homophobic chants, demonstrators yelled “Here are the nationalists,” a reference to those who supported dictator Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). One person was arrested for “assaulting another protester,” according to Inmaculada Sanz, the spokesperson for Madrid City Hall. The march was organized by the San Blas-Canillejas Association under the banner “Say No to the 2030-2050 Agenda,” in reference to the Spanish government’s planned reforms in education, healthcare, taxes, jobs, pensions and the environment over the next three decades. In an image to promote the event on social media, the organizers described these reforms as “an attack on the culture and identity of the people of Spain.” But while the demonstration was organized under this banner, it had nothing to do with these issues. Sources from the central government’s delegation in Madrid said it had authorized the demonstration on the understanding it was an anti-government march, not a homophobic, neo-Nazi protest. Equality Minister Irene Montero, from the leftist Unidas Podemos, wrote via Twitter on Sunday that she would take legal action against the organizers, adding that the central government – a coalition of the Socialist Party (PSOE) and her own party – is finalizing the so-called ”Trans Law” to protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. Protesters set off a flare at the homophobic march in Madrid. Olmo Calvo The march comes amid growing concern over homophobia in Spain. According to the observatory, there have been 103 homophobic assaults so far this year in Madrid. Despite this, the premier of the Madrid region, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, of the conservative Popular Party (PP), which appealed the same-sex marriage law introduced in 2005, said last week that “homophobia is inside the head of the [political] left.” Ayuso also indicated that she is open to reviewing the regional law against homophobia, which was approved by the previous PP administration in 2016. This is a demand of the far-right party Vox, on whose votes the PP relies on to pass key legislation. In condemning the neo-Nazi demonstration, many politicians criticized the premier’s soft stance on homophobia. Carolina Darias, the spokesperson of Unidas Podemos in the Madrid regional assembly, said the march “refutes the words of Ayuso who said at the last meeting that there was no hate speech in Madrid and that it was an invention of the left to annoy her.” Rita Maestre, the spokesperson of the leftist Más Madrid party, also accused the PP of “denying the existence of hate speech,” while Santiago Rivero, a regional deputy from the PSOE and LGBTQ+ rights activist, added: “Ayuso said that Madrid is a region free of LGBTQ-phobia and that is not true, because we keep seeing how a social minority continues to consider us inferior and continues to insult us and attack us on the street.” Neo-Nazi protesters march down the streets of the LGBTQ+-friendly neighborhood of Chueca. Olmo Calvo “The parsimony of institutions, far from fighting this hate speech, protects it and legitimizes it, putting at risk social harmony and even the safety of the LGBTQ+ community,” said Álvaro Aguilera, the coordinator of the Madrid branch of Izquierda Unida (United Left). Vox leader Santiago Abascal, meanwhile, described the protesters as a “group of crazy people and fanatics” and said the demonstration “stank of the Socialist sewers,” suggesting that the protest had somehow been arranged by the party. Figures from the Interior Ministry reflect that, in the first six months of this year, the police and Civil Guard have received 610 reports related to hate crimes, which is 9.3% up on the same period in 2019, when there were 558 – a previous record since these statistics began to be tracked in 2014. A recent survey carried out by the same ministry revealed that just one in 10 people who suffer a hate crime report it to the police. In June, a 24-year-old nurse named Samuel Luiz was beaten to death in the Galician city of A Coruña in a suspected homophobic attack. English version by Melissa Kitson."

The companies said their two-dose vaccine generated an immune response in the 5-to-11 year olds in a Phase II/III clinical trial that matched what was previously observed in 16-to-25 year olds. The safety profile was also generally comparable to the older age group, they added. ""Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. - underscoring the public health need for vaccination,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a news release. ""These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency,"" Bourla added. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already has won U.S. regulatory authorization for people age 12 and up, including full Food and Drug Administration approval last month for ages 16 and up. Top U.S. health officials believe regulators could make a decision on whether the shot is safe and effective in younger children within three weeks of the companies submitting a request for authorization, two sources told Reuters this month. A rapid authorization could help mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide. COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths have surged in the United States in recent months due to the highly contagious Delta variant, especially in areas with low vaccination rates even as President Joe Biden implores vaccine holdouts to get their shots. Pediatric cases are also up, particularly as children under 12 are all unvaccinated, but there is no indication that, beyond being more transmissible, the Delta virus is more dangerous in kids. FDA acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said that once the agency receives the application, its process for determining if the vaccine is safe and effective for children in the younger age group includes verifying the manufacturing processes for the lower concentrations of the shots and any study of its safety. ""We'll look at the clinical data and make sure that children responded to the vaccine the way we would expect,"" Woodcock said during an appearance on former Biden administration official Andy Slavitt's podcast. Pfizer shares fell 1.3% to $43.28 before the bell on Monday amid broader market weakness. A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a ""Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine"" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic DATA FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, called Comirnaty, is authorized for use in children as young as 12 in many countries in addition to the United States. It was originally authorized for emergency use in people 16 or older in the United States in December 2020. The 5-to-11 year olds were given two shots of a 10-microgram dose of the vaccine, a third the dose size given to people 12 and older. In addition, the companies said they expect data on how well the vaccine works in children ages 2-to-5 years and children ages 6 months-to-2 years as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. Unlike the larger clinical trial that the drugmakers previously conducted in adults, the 2,268-participant pediatric trial was not primarily designed to measure the vaccine's efficacy by comparing the number of COVID-19 cases in vaccine recipients to those who received a placebo. Instead, it compares the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in the adult trial. A Pfizer spokesperson said the companies may later disclose vaccine efficacy from the trial but there have not been enough cases of COVID-19 yet among the participants to make that determination. The vaccine was around 95 percent effective in the adult clinical trial, but Pfizer has said that immunity wanes some months after the second dose. U.S. regulators are expected to authorize a third, booster dose of the vaccine for older and high-risk Americans early this week. The companies said the vaccine was well-tolerated, with side effects generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of three shots authorized in the United States, along with Moderna's (MRNA.O) two-dose vaccine and Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) one-dose shot. The Moderna and J&J shots have not yet received full FDA approval for any age groups. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been linked by regulators to rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, particularly young men. Pfizer said they did not see any instances of heart inflammation in the trial participants.

The European Commission ordered Poland to stop operations at the Turów lignite mine in May following a lawsuit launched by the Czech Republic. Poland has so far failed to comply with the order and the Polish government said in a statement Monday it would continue to do so -- even though the European Court of Justice ruling means it will have to pay the daily penalty.

Turów supplies power to around 2.3 million Polish households, according to PGE, the state-controlled company that runs the mine. It is also an important local employer, with one in every two jobs in the region directly or indirectly dependent on it. But it has long been at a center of an international dispute. The Turów mine is located in a tiny, appendix-like tip of Poland, right at the border with Germany and the Czech Republic.

(Photo: Reuters) Scientists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore are tackling food waste by turning discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages. The process extracts cellulose powder from the fruit's husks after they are sliced and freeze-dried, then mixes it with glycerol. This mixture becomes soft hydrogel, which is then cut into bandage strips. ""In Singapore, we consume about 12 million durians a year, so besides the flesh, we can't do much about the husk and the seeds and this cause environmental pollution,"" said Professor William Chen, director of the food science and technology programme at NTU. The fruit's husks, which make up more than half of the composition of durians, are usually discarded and incinerated, contributing to environmental waste.

The researchers say using waste materials and yeast for the antimicrobial bandages is more cost effective than the production of conventional bandages, whose antimicrobial properties come from more expensive metallic compounds like silver or copper ions. A durian wholeseller, Tan Eng Chuan, said he goes through at least 30 crates of durians a day during durian season - as much as 1,800 kg. Being able to use the parts of the fruit that are ordinarily discarded, he said, was an innovation that would make enjoying it ""more sustainable""."

EXCLUSIVE Alarming new data has revealed that the number of koalas in Australia has plummeted by 30 per cent in just three years. Whereas once Australia was home to eight million of the marsupials, there now could be only around 30,000 remaining. In figures given exclusively to news.com.au, the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) has stated the mammal is now extinct in seven regions where in 2018 there were still populations – and some areas have just five to 10 of the animals left. It’s estimated there are only between 32,000 and 58,000 koalas left in the wild – that’s down from between 46,000 and 82,000 three years ago. That’s far fewer than official government estimates which put koala numbers as high as half a million. But the AKF insists its numbers are more reliable. There are now real fears this symbol of Australia could die out completely. An ecologist has told news.com.au that koalas were “stuffed” and it was only a matter of time before they died out completely. There are real fears koalas will become extinct in the near future. Picture: The Australian Reptile Park Only two regions with more than 5000 koalas The AKF has stated that the falls have been across the board but are highest in Queensland which may now have just 6500 koalas remaining. The numbers are broken down by federal electorate with just two, Mayo, south of Adelaide, and Corangamite, close to Geelong, now having more than 5000 koalas. A further 24 electorates have fewer than 100 koalas left. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw the numbers,” AKF chair Deborah Tabart said. “There used to be five electorates with more than 5000 animals and now there’s only two and it’s shocking that it’s happened in just three years. “I’ve counted the dead bodies of koalas in Queensland. Over seven years there’s been something like 20,000 of them.” She wants to see a “Great Koala Trail” built across eastern Australia to help koala populations grow once more. Ms Tabart blames political parties of all stripes for not doing enough to save the creature. Indeed, the NSW Coalition almost fell apart last year over a plan put forward by Liberals to preserve more tree types so koalas could roam, which was not supported by the Nationals. ‘Koalas are stuffed’ “I don’t like to use the word extinct because I think it takes hope away. But it’s clear koalas are under threat, there’s no question they’re in trouble,” she said. Flinders University’s professor of ecology Corey Bradshaw is more blunt about it. “Koalas are stuffed,” he told news.com.au. “When they go extinct is up for debate, but whether they will go extinct is not really up for debate anymore. “Most of their native habitats have been cleared, they’ve been highly fragmented by roads and property development. Then you’ve got a lot of genetic problems and diseases and then the ones that survive that get taken out by dogs and hit by cars. “Add bushfires, and there’s not a lot of long-term hope for that species in particular.” Sam Mitchell, owner of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, carries a dead koala and kangaroo to a mass gravesite after devastating bushfires in January 2000. Picture: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images Climate change impact on Aussie animals Prof Bradshaw said the plight of the koala highlighted the impact of climate change which was another blow to animals that were already suffering. “Most animals decline towards extinction, they don’t go for a single reason,” he said. A species that has seen its habitat dwindle through deforestation might then be wiped out by a bushfire, whipped up by higher temperatures and ripping through the one area where it remained abundant. Indeed, the bushfires of 2019 are thought to have killed three billion animals. “It’s the frequency of extreme events that become the problem,” Prof Bradshaw said. “It didn’t give time for fragile wildlife to recover. “It’s like you smack them on the head and they have time to heal; and then you smack them again, they’re still going to be around. But if you smack them again and again, the chance of survival is much lower.” Koala kiss points The Australian Government has a list of 2000 species currently under threat. The koala is listed as “vulnerable” but could be moved to “endangered”. The AKF has a vision of a “Great Koala Trail,” an unbroken koala habitat stretching 2443km from Cairns to Adelaide. Ms Tabart said much of the habitats were broken up but some were so close they could be connected by “kiss points” where vegetation could be planted to bridge the gap. “If we achieve contiguous habitat, then all creatures great and small could traverse through the bush unthreatened,” she said. “Humans could walk under this trail of gum trees with koalas happily in the branches overhead.” She also wants to see landowners incentivised to keep and grow more trees. “I still have hope,” Ms Tabart said, “as long as we get on with it.”"

Joined by dozens of other cyclists, the women rode to the Monument to the Revolution, in the center of Mexico City, for the event dubbed ""Mexico embraces you."" In the midst the Covid-19 pandemic, the team, made up of about 20 young women, who won a special award at the 2017 World Robotics Championship, created a new type of respirator made out of old car parts.

The group, made up of five team members and one of their partners, were the first Afghan refugees to arrive in Mexico after the Taliban retook the country from the American-backed government after 20 years last month. Mexico has since received a total of 391 Afghans -- mostly translators and their families -- who fear a return of the historically repressive policies of the Taliban. Mexico's deputy foreign minister Martha Delgado, who organized the team's resettlement on a humanitarian basis, accompanied the group on her bicycle, a traditional Sunday afternoon pastime in Mexico City.

After a short speech, three of the young women rode toward the iconic Angel of Independence statue, while another rode on a taxi tricycle. The group then joined the hundreds of other cyclists pedaling along the Paseo de la Reforma, which is closed to vehicle traffic on Sundays to make room for the traditional weekly ride.

Along with their 6-month-old sister, the girls are oblivious to the threat they now face from the Taliban, Afghanistan's new rulers. Their mother, Nabila, is one of 250 female judges ordered not to return to work by a regime that doesn't condone women in senior positions. CNN is only using Nabila's first name for her own protection. Nabila said she feared reprisals, not only from fundamentalists, but also the men she once jailed. When they came to power, the Taliban opened the gates of prisons, releasing thousands of convicted criminals. ""Now we do not feel safe; the same criminals are going after my own life, the lives of my family,"" Nabila said. ""God forbid if they seek revenge."" After the Taliban takeover in mid-August, a few dozen women judges fled Afghanistan, and those left behind are now in hiding, according to Judge Vanessa Ruiz from the US-based International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ). All of the judges who worked under the former Afghan government -- male and female -- have been now replaced by Taliban appointees, two judges told CNN. But Ruiz said women judges feared their gender made them particular targets for a regime that assigns greater value to men. Many of the women judges presided over the worst cases of violence against women, including rape, murder and domestic abuse. ""They would be angry at any judge who sentenced them, but that a woman had official authority, and sat in judgment of a man, is rage of a completely different order,"" said Ruiz. The IAWJ and other organizations are racing to find a safe passage out for the women -- but they say they need more help from the US and other Western nations, before it's too late. Nabila is one of hundreds of women judges in Afghanistan who have been told they can no longer work. ""They can't see their mother being killed"" The risks for Afghanistan's women judges pre-date the Taliban's takeover of the country. In January, two Supreme Court judges were shot dead in Kabul by unidentified gunmen, though the Taliban denied responsibility, according to Reuters. Since then, threats against Afghan women -- and people affiliated with the former government -- have intensified. Last week, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michele Bachelet told the Human Rights Council her office had heard ""multiple allegations"" of the Taliban going door to door, looking for specific government officials and people who had cooperated with the United States. Furthermore, she said women had been ""progressively excluded from the public sphere,"" and faced increasing restrictions in ""numerous professional sectors."" Nabila said it wasn't long before she received death threats. ""A day or two after the Taliban arrived in Kabul, my personal number was called and I was threatened with revenge, threatened with murder,"" Nabila said. She canceled her phone numbers, and the family is now moving from house to house every few days to avoid being tracked down. Unnamed high court judge and some of her eight nephews and niece, who are now in Poland. Another judge, Bibi, has been in hiding with her three young children since the Taliban entered Kabul. ""My worst fear is that my kids ... they can't see their mother being killed,"" said Bibi, who is only using her first name for safety reasons. ""We haven't slept well, we haven't eaten well. We just wait, we have stopped living like a normal human being."" Bibi had to leave her workplace in a hurry as Kabul fell and wasn't able to return to her office, which contains all her work files and her personal information, including her photograph, phone number and home address. She fears the Taliban -- or former prisoners -- could use the information to track them down. ""They feel like it's their right to find me, to hit me, to kill me, they don't have anyone to be afraid of,"" she said. Both Nabila and Bibi and their families are trying to leave Afghanistan with the help of organizations including the IAWJ, but progress is slow. Ruiz said they are doing all they can, but their resources are limited, and she urged Western countries to do more. ""Governments need to be better, more agile, more generous frankly, in giving admission to people who are in danger in Afghanistan right now,"" Ruiz said. ""You've got to cut the red tape when you're dealing with an emergency, and we're dealing with an emergency."" Ruiz said the US in particular should be trying to help these women, as several dozen of the judges passed through a judicial education program funded by the US government. ""It's their association with us, in many ways, that puts them at risk,"" Ruiz said. The US says it has continued to evacuate Americans, Afghans and other nationals from Kabul, even after the August 31 deadline. Two evacuation flights left Kabul in the last two weeks, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Tuesday. ""We will continue to help Americans -- and Afghans to whom we have a special commitment -- depart Afghanistan if they choose, just as we've done in other countries where we've evacuated our embassy,"" Blinken said. ""There's no deadline to this mission."" ""The Taliban came after me"" Only a few dozen women judges have managed to escape Afghanistan so far. One experienced judge made it out on a flight from Kabul to Poland along with family members including eight nephews and nieces. But it wasn't an easy journey. ""I was at the airport gate for two nights with too many crowds, and I had a lot of kids with me,"" said the judge, who did not want to be named to protect family members still in Afghanistan. ""The three days and two nights I had in Kabul Airport were really the worst nights of my life, but we got through it. I had no (other) hope of survival."" Afghans gather on a roadside near the military part of the airport in Kabul on August 20, 2021. She knew she had to flee the country after the Taliban tried to track her down. ""Five Taliban came to my area asking my neighbors about me,"" she said. ""When I knew the Taliban came after me, I relocated from that area also, because I was so scared if they found me."" As well as fearing for their families, the women are also mourning their hard-won careers. ""Now I feel like I lost everything,"" the experienced judge said. ""Imagine you have a personality, a career, respect, a home, a car, a life and everything, and suddenly you leave in one set of clothes on your body and leave the country -- now how would you feel?"" ""We're not going to abandon them"" For those stuck in Afghanistan, the frustration and fear are mounting. ""We that are left behind, we all express our anger, disappointment,"" Bibi said. ""We have (been) deprived of our right to work,"" said Nabila. ""We find it impossible for us to live in Afghanistan."" Ruiz of the IAWJ said they won't give up until every woman judge is safe. ""We're not going to abandon them. We're not going to forget them. And we're not going to let the world ignore them,"" Ruiz said. ""We will not stop until this job is completed, and every woman judge who is threatened, and wishes to leave Afghanistan is able to do so."" Despite the dangers, Nabila is dedicated to her chosen career path and hopes to one day return to the bench. ""I do not regret all about the field I have chosen and for which I have studied for many years,"" Nabila said. ""We have been working for many years to combat violence, oppression and injustice, and I want to continue with my work."" Nabila's bravery is driven by a passion to protect Afghanistan's most vulnerable women, and to try to create a better future for her daughters -- a generation that now faces a dark reality under the new regime."

The pair of drugs – which work together to block the signals cancer cells need to grow – could offer a new treatment option for women with a type of ovarian cancer that rarely responds to chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Experts said the “fantastic” results from early trials of the new drug combination, presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress, suggested the treatment was highly effective. They were so successful that a phase 2 trial is already under way. Researchers said they were delighted with the outcome, and hope it could mean a significant advance in treatment if the results are replicated in larger trials. The phase 1 trial, led by a team at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, tested the drugs VS-6766 and defactinib in patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Experts said this type of cancer tends to develop at a younger age, less than 13% of patients respond to chemotherapy and less than 14% respond to hormone therapy. Trial results show that of the 24 patients evaluated, 46% saw their tumours shrink significantly in response to the treatment. The outcomes were even better in patients with a particular mutation, with 64% who have KRAS-driven tumours seeing them shrink after treatment. The researchers said this indicated that tumour profiles could be used to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatment. They said those taking part in the trial – aged between 31 and 75 – lived for an average of 23 months before their cancer progressed. “Overcoming cancer’s ability to evolve resistance to treatment is a huge challenge for cancer research,” said Prof Kristian Helin, the chief executive of the ICR. “This study has turned a deep understanding of how cancer fuels its growth and develops resistance into a highly targeted treatment for patients who currently have few treatment options.” Dr Susana Banerjee, also from the ICR and consultant medical oncologist and research lead at the Royal Marsden’s gynaecology unit, said: “If these findings are confirmed in larger trials, they’ll represent a significant advance in low-grade serous ovarian cancer treatment.” The combination treatment worked even in patients who had already received an MEK inhibitor – something which can cause tumours to shrink but tends to stop working as tumours develop resistance to treatment – before the study, Banerjee said. She added: “I am delighted that this drug combination has worked so well in a group of patients who are in urgent need of new treatments, including those who have previously been treated with a MEK inhibitor. We’re very hopeful that this could become the standard of care for women with low-grade serous ovarian cancer.” Separately at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress, the trial of a new drug to treat a form of breast cancer was hailed as “groundbreaking”, with results said to suggest a strong trend towards improved overall survival. AstraZeneca said Enhertu demonstrated a 72% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer compared with a different medicine. The trial, involving about 500 patients in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America, found there was “a strong trend towards improved overall survival” with Enhertu. But it was also pointed out that this analysis was “not yet mature and is not statistically significant”. Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, a senior research communications manager at Breast Cancer Now, said: “These are incredibly promising results, and we now hope that further research will show whether this treatment could also offer patients precious extra time to live and be there for more moments that matter.”"

In statement issued Thursday, the UK said thousands of European Union laws that the UK retained after Brexit ""will be scrutinised by the Government to ensure they are helping the UK to thrive as a modern, dynamic, independent country and foster innovation across the British economy."" The announcement said the government will be considering laws that have an impact on technology, transportation, and agriculture. It also said it would be ""reviewing the EU ban on markings and sales in imperial units and legislating in due course, none of which were possible within the EU."" Under the EU, supermarkets in the UK were required to list measurements for fruits and vegetables in the metric system, such as grams and kilograms, starting in 1994. However, the EU allowed Britain to use imperial measurements alongside metric, according to The New York Times. Most of the world uses the metric system of weights and measurements. The US uses the imperial system. UK newspaper i news said the EU-imposed metric system has ""long been a flashpoint for anti-EU campaigners.""

""We now have the opportunity to do things differently and ensure that Brexit freedoms are used to help businesses and citizens get on and succeed,"" Frost said. Critics have said changes to such rules seem insignificant in light of the difficulties businesses are having filling positions, driven ""in part because of the exodus of European Union immigrants since the vote to leave the bloc,"" The New York Times reported.

The data comes from researchers at the University of Chicago who run the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which quantifies poor air quality according to lost life years. They calculate that up to 17 billion life years could be saved if air pollution was brought down to the benchmark for clean air: the WHO guideline of 10 µg/m32. Staggeringly, the average exposure for the world’s population to particulate pollution is currently three times that amount, at concentrations of 32 µg/m3. The main cause of this pollution? Fossil fuels – particularly coal. ‘Coal is the source of the problem in most parts of the world,’ Professor Michael Greenstone, co-author of the report, told the Guardian. ‘If these [health] costs were embedded in prices, coal would be uncompetitive in almost all parts of the world.’ The report candidly links fossil fuels to the dangers of both climate breakdown and air pollution; it identifies a ‘wildfire feedback loop’ whereby fossil fuel combustion creates both particulate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the latter of which increases wildfires. Fires in turn fuel both pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, escalating the cycle. However, the harms of air pollution are not evenly measured out per global citizen. Instead, industrialising parts of the developing world bear the brunt of the damages. For example, AQLI estimates that Londoners are losing a few months of life on average. Meanwhile, on the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India (population 480 million, including Delhi and Kolkata), inhabitants are predicted to die over nine years early if 2019 pollution levels persist. These devastating statistics are the reality of life and death under global fossil capitalism. In some countries, there have been improvements in environmental conditions. The report celebrates China’s accomplishments since they declared ‘war on pollution’ in 2014: particulate pollution dropped by 29 percent between 2013 and 2019. These gains account for three quarters of the reductions in air pollution across the world. Although poor air quality still robs 2.6 years of life off the average Chinese citizen, strong policies such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants, iron and steel making, and numbers of cars in cities has made strides forward. The findings bring into sharp focus the need for a just transition away from fossil fuels everywhere, not just in the Global North. Developed countries have a historic duty to assist and finance developing countries in their green transitions, to mitigate global warming and draw down polluted air simultaneously; this kind of reparative climate justice is critical not least due to the legacies of colonialism and slavery that built the wealth of much of the Global North and reverberate through global structural inequality today. For example, War on Want and others have estimated that to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s ‘fair share’ contribution to overseas aid is £1 trillion. However, the real figures on climate finance are much slimmer. In 2010 at COP16, developed countries pledged a cumulative $100 billion per year in climate finance to address the needs of developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation. Even this amount is yet to be fulfilled, and tracking the true figures is a murky process. The OECD reported levels of $78.9 billion in 2018, but this number has been challenged by researchers. Meanwhile, the needs of developing countries continue to expand. India alone—the most polluted country on the planet, according to the AQLI—has calculated climate action will cost $2.5 trillion up to 2030. The most significant burdens are in energy transition and mitigation action, plus adaptation for agriculture, forestry, water resources, and ecosystems. $100 billion, equivalent to just four percent of India’s total estimated costs, is fundamentally inadequate to overhaul the global fossil economy. The richest countries on the planet are absconding from their responsibilities to secure a liveable, breathable planet both at home and abroad. The impacts of bad air quality are not exclusive to the Global South. Despite big improvements, the AQLI shows that almost three-quarters of Europeans still live in areas which exceed WHO guidelines on particulate pollution. And early mortality only tells one story – air pollution also impacts morbidity, the rate of illness in a living population. This was tragically laid bare by the death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah in 2013, who lived in Lewisham. An inquest found that air pollution contributed both to her developing a rare form of asthma and then to exacerbating the condition. Although Sadiq Khan is attempting to tackle London’s toxic air by expanding the ultra-low emissions zone, targeting the major root cause of particulate pollution means an outright rejection of fossil fuels. Transforming toxic air around the globe requires urgent action and—in the first instance—a restructuring of climate finance to secure support for the Global South. These countries are most dependent on fossil fuels and most fatally impacted by both climate breakdown and dirty air. An inhabitable earth is within grasp, with clean air so all of us can live longer and healthier lives."

A new study published yesterday in the journal Nature found that 60 percent of oil and natural gas, and a whopping 90 percent of coal, must remain unextracted and unused between now and 2050 in order for the world to have at least a 50 percent shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These results are broadly consistent with the findings of numerous recent reports, from the United Nations, the International Energy Agency and others, which have “all provided evidence that dramatic cuts in fossil fuel production are required immediately in order to move towards limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees,” said Dan Welsby, a researcher at University College London and lead author of the study, at a press conference announcing the results. Under the Paris climate agreement, nations are working to keep global temperatures within 2 C of their preindustrial levels, and within 1.5 C if at all possible. Research suggests that the effects of climate change—melting ice, rising seas, more extreme weather and so on—will be worse at 2 C than at 1.5 C, and worse still at higher temperatures. These targets are an attempt to limit the consequences of global warming as much as possible. Yet studies increasingly suggest that the 1.5 C target is looming closer and closer. The world has already warmed by more than a degree Celsius since the start of the industrial era, which began about 150 years ago. A landmark U.N. report on climate change, released last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warned that the 1.5 C mark could be reached within two decades. To have even a 50 percent chance of meeting the target, the U.N. report suggests, the world can emit only about 460 billion metric tons of additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That’s another 12 years or so of emissions at the rate at which the world is currently going. That means global carbon emissions need to fall sharply, and immediately, in order to meet the goal. The new study, published by four researchers from University College London, paints a similarly urgent portrait. But it looks at the future from a different angle. Instead of calculating the emissions consistent with a 1.5 C target, it calculates the amount of fossil fuel reserves that must go unused. The study started with a carbon budget of about 580 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s based on an earlier IPCC report, from 2018, focused on the 1.5 C target. (The newest report suggests a substantially smaller budget.) The researchers then used a special model to simulate how the world’s energy systems might evolve over the coming decades to stay within that budget. For instance, the simulations suggest a rapid shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources. The model also assumes a substantial amount of carbon dioxide removal in the future—using various forms of technology to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. Even with these assumptions, the strict carbon budget was “essentially the very limit of what our model can solve for,” said James Price, another author of the study. The model attempts to stick within realistic constraints on costs and the speed at which global economies can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. The model suggested that steep cuts in fossil fuel production are necessary between now and 2050 to meet the 1.5 C target. For certain types of fossil fuels in certain parts of the world, the model implied that production should have already peaked by now. For others, production must begin falling right away. For all regions of the world, for instance, the study suggests that coal production should have already peaked. Oil production in all regions should have peaked by now or at least by the year 2025. For natural gas, there’s a more complicated regional picture. In much of Europe, the United States and Russia, for instance, gas production must peak now. On the other hand, gas production may continue to increase for a time in other parts of the world. The Middle East, Africa and certain parts of Asia might see gas production increase until the 2030s before beginning to fall. Altogether, oil and gas production must decline by about 3 percent each year through 2050, the study found. Many regions with the largest fossil fuel reserves must keep proportionately large shares of those resources in the ground. Canada, for instance, must keep 83 percent of its extractable oil in the ground, compared with about 38 percent in Russia and other former Soviet states. In the United States, the study suggests that 31 percent of oil reserves, 52 percent of natural gas and 97 percent of coal must stay in the ground. These cuts are already steep. But it’s likely that the study has underestimated the challenge, the authors warn. For one thing, the study investigates only what must be done to have a 50 percent chance of meeting the 1.5 C target. Better odds would require even stronger action. The study also assumes a larger carbon budget—meaning it allows for more carbon emissions—than the most up-to-date U.N. report suggests. And the model used in the study also assumes a lot of future carbon dioxide removal, relying on technologies many scientists are still skeptical about. So are these production cuts even possible? “Certainly they are technically possible,” Welsby said. But he cautioned that, at the moment, “our global plans and operational fossil fuel trajectories are going in completely the wrong direction.” “It really is a case of having the political will to resist the temptation of extracting every last bit of fossil fuels, as it were, and focus on really pushing hard on the low-carbon economy. It is definitely feasible, but it really comes down to the politics of the situation,” Price added. At the same time, the Paris Agreement’s 2 C target remains well within reach. Even if the 1.5 C target is swiftly approaching, experts have repeatedly cautioned that this doesn’t mean there’s any reason to give up on climate action. Most climate consequences occur on a gradient—every little bit of warming makes them worse, which means that every little bit of prevented warming makes a difference. Overshooting 1.5 C doesn’t mean the world would immediately fall off a climate cliff. At the same time, working to limit global temperatures as much as possible should remain the ultimate goal. “Given the level of evidence that to get as close as possible to 1.5 degrees will offset the worst impacts of our changing climate, I think that is why we tried to push our model as far as it would go toward 1.5,” Welsby said.

Another – potentially more controversial – one called for the legalisation of cannabis in Finland. This would mean that the use, possession, manufacture and sale of the cannabis plant would be decriminalised, explained party secretary Veli Liikanen. The initiative was approved by the narrowest possible majority, 183-181. ""The vote was close. It was decided by a margin of only two votes. That, of course, indicates that there are different positions on this policy within the Greens,"" Liikanen noted. With the vote, the Greens became the first party in the Finnish Parliament to call for legalisation of marijuana. The opposition National Coalition Party's youth wing made a similar call last year. In 2019, Greens chair and interior minister Maria Ohisalo said that the use and possession of small quantities of illicit drugs should not be punishable. Two potential interior ministers voted 'yes' Ohisalo is beginning parental leave soon, and will be replaced as interior minister by one of the three deputy chairs elected on Saturday: MPs Hanna Holopainen, Atte Harjanne and Iiris Suomela. Of these, the latter two voted in favour of legalisation. The Interior Ministry oversees Finland's police. According to the initiative, criminal convictions for cannabis use should be scrubbed from citizens' personal data registers. THL professor: ""A significant statement"" Liikanen says that the current drug policy based on penalties and restrictions has not succeeded in reducing harm. ""The Greens have focused on shifting drug policy from punishment to harm reduction. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) have urged the same for years,"" he said. ""Of course, this is a significant statement when you consider that this is one of Finland's governing parties taking such a position,"" THL research professor Pekka Hakkarainen told Yle. ""Based on a 2018 survey, 18 percent of Finns thought that cannabis should be legally available. Personally, I have considered it more important that the criminalisation of use be abandoned. This would not just apply to cannabis, but to all substances, and we could better address problem use,"" said Hakkarainen."

During the event that started late Wednesday, Kim, wearing a cream suit and a shiny white tie, emerged as the clock struck midnight. He beamed in response to thunderous applause from performers and spectators filling Pyongyang’s brightly illuminated Kim Il Sung Square, named after his grandfather and founder of the nation on its 73rd anniversary. He smiled widely, waved to the crowd and kissed children who presented him with flowers before taking his spot on a balcony to observe the parade. He laughed vigorously and applauded the marchers throughout the event, while chatting animatedly with senior officials. It was a stark change from 2018, when TV footage showed him struggling to catch his breath while accompanying South Korean President Moon Jae-in on a short hike to North Korea’s Mount Paektu during a period of diplomatic engagement. Moon, who is three decades older than Kim, didn’t seemed fazed by the walk at all. “His face is clearly thinner and he is moving much more vigorously,” said Park Won-gon, a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. Kim’s weight loss became noticeable in June, when he made his first public appearance in weeks to convene a ruling party meeting. Some North Korea watchers then said that Kim, who is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and has previously weighed 308 pounds, may have lost 22-44 pounds. Most experts say Kim’s weight loss is more likely a result of efforts to improve his shape than an indicator of health problems, considering his regular public activity. It may also have a political purpose. Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade of rule, with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons, pandemic border closures that cause further strain to its broken economy, and food shortages worsened by floods in recent summers. It has become crucial for Kim to build an image as a young and vigorous leader who can steer the country out of trouble, analyst Park said. Such image-making efforts would align with the latest parade, which showcased civil defense units involved in efforts to rebuild the economy and communities destroyed by floods and emphasized a domestic message for unity. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Kim, with his weight loss and cheerful demeanor at the parade, is likely trying to project an image of a “normal statesman” who engages with the public. “He’s also a husband and a father of three children who is approaching his 40s, so it isn’t strange that he would care about his health,” Yang said. Kim’s health is the focus of keen outside attention as the 37-year-old leader hasn’t publicly anointed a successor who would take control of North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal targeting Asian rivals and the American homeland. He has been known for heavy drinking and smoking and comes from a family with a history of heart problems. His grandfather and father, who ruled North Korea before him, both died of heart issues. “Considering the North’s political system, where the supreme leader decides everything, Kim’s health is an extremely important security matter,” Park said. “It’s likely there were internal concerns that he was overweight, and it would have been important for Kim to reduce those concerns and present himself as a young and healthy leader who’s capable of doing things.”"

New figures from OneRoof and its data partner Valocity show the typical cost of a property across New Zealand increased 4.9% in the last three months and increased 27% since September 2020. The doubling of the national average property value in less than a decade will put further pressure on first home buyers, and many may see deposit requirements pushed up to $200,000 - more than three times the average annual wage. OneRoof editor Owen Vaughan said: “The figures show the extent of the house price surge after the first Covid lockdown last year and raise concerns that measures aimed at slowing house price growth are not working fast enough. House-hunters are now spending about $213,000 more than they did a year ago on the typical home.” He said much of the national growth has been fuelled by price jumps of more than 30% in Gisborne, Manawatu-Whanganui, Wellington, Hawke's Bay and Bay of Plenty. “The acceleration in house prices has seen Wellington and Tauranga join Auckland and Queenstown-Lakes in the $1,000,000 club, with Hamilton, Napier, Hastings, Nelson and Whangarei not far behind,” he said. “It’s amazing to think that the average property value for all of New Zealand has hit one million less than 20 years since the country recorded its first million dollar suburb and Auckland became the first million dollar city,” said Vaughan. Auckland remains the most expensive place to buy property, Vaughan said, with the city recording an average property value of $1.415m (up 24% on last year) while West Coast is New Zealand's most affordable housing market, with an average property value of $353,000. Despite the price increases, first-home buyers' share of new mortgage registrations over the year has held steady at around 40%, Vaughan said. “But the surge has meant that buyers searching now would need to stump up $50,000 more for a 20% deposit than those purchasing this time last year.” The price growth is taking place against a backdrop of a slowdown in listings and sales volumes, and expectations that prices will jump further once the country is fully out of lockdown and buyers try to secure a home before expected interest rates rise. Nationally, there were 6% fewer homes available for sale in August month compared to July and 36% fewer listings than in August 2020. The monthly drop in new listings was even sharper, with the number of new properties coming to market last month down nearly 19% on the month before. “Interest in property had surged during the Covid lockdown, with visits to OneRoof in the last month up almost 10% on the month before,” said Chief of OneRoof Paul Maher. “Covid hasn't curbed Kiwis' appetite for property. In fact, the opposite is true. Most buyers and sellers will be well aware of what happened to prices after the country came out of the last national lockdown. ""The fact that readership of our property news and housing market insights over the lockdown has jumped 25% on the month before shows Kiwis want to stay updated and are hungry to know more about what's happening in these uncertain times,"" said Maher. © Scoop Media "

It's known locally as Afghanistan's Guantanamo. Those who were held here feared they'd never leave. Many who did leave have never been the same since. We're the first Western television team to get inside the infamous prison. Both the Americans and their Afghan security partners are particularly sensitive about outside eyes seeing inside. Image: The Taliban freed prisoners when they took over Bagram airbase Image: Burned out hard drives and documents are seen at the facility Image: A mechanic shop We squeeze through twisted sheets of corrugated metal where captives forced their way out hours after the capital fell to the Taliban and only weeks after the US soldiers left the base in a hurry. The Taliban unlocked all the cells holding those who hadn't been able to break out themselves - among them hundreds suspected of being ISIS-K prisoners, from an offshoot of the so-called Islamic State terrorist group. Now the Taliban is manning the gates of the huge sprawling military base which grew into a small city and was the coalition's main military hub during its 20-year-long military mission. Originally built by Russian invaders in the 1950s, the Americans extended it to include a gym, a 50-bed hospital and the much-feared detention centre. Advertisement Image: A deflated American football has been left behind Image: Taliban fighters pray inside the cells Image: Abandoned American ammunition and oil kegs In the detention centre, they housed and interrogated the Taliban fighters they caught in battle or suspects they feared would end up on the battlefield. Some were viewed as high-ranking terror suspects but there were also hundreds of ordinary Afghans - farmers, stallholders, students and Taliban sympathisers deemed dangerous or suspicious. They were held, sometimes for years, without charges or trials. The stories of torture, water boarding, abuse, beatings and mistreatment were rife. Image: The airbase was the coalition's main military hub Image: It's thought the prison could have been a breeding ground for radicalisation Former president Hamid Karzai told Sky News in an interview he gave before the Taliban pushed out the Ashraf Ghani government that the existence of the Bagram detention centre and the terrible stories emanating from within it infuriated him and caused multiple fallouts between him and the American politicians he dealt with. He never forgave his American partners for what happened inside Bagram detention centre. ""They were meant to come here for peace, not bomb villages and hold captives,"" he told us in July. The Americans said a few years ago they handed over control to the Afghan security partners they had trained but few in the country believed the US relinquished complete control especially as the centre sits inside the military base they ran and operated. For most Afghans, the Bagram detention centre was firmly an American creation and one which continues to be a terrible stain on their reputation. Every dark, dank corridor and every ransacked room in the detention centre holds a story - and all of them seem grim. Image: The prison was known locally as Afghanistan's Guantanamo Image: The Taliban flag flies on a checkpoint at the entrance to Bagram There are dozens of scattered photographs of terrified-looking men, many of them young, staring out at the camera dressed in their orange prisoner suits, pressed up against height charts. The interrogation rooms are heavily padded to ensure they're sound-proofed and the lack of electricity means we are stumbling around in the dark using the lights on our mobile phones, which adds to the eeriness. In one storeroom we find black-out goggles and earmuffs, probably used for sensory deprivation alongside piles and piles of orange suits, next to cable ties of varying lengths.

The Talibs wind their way down the steps leading into a windowless bricked ground floor where there are a series of steel cages which each housed about 30 captives. Image: Taliban fighters flip through books and rifle through the belongings Image: Shackles on the floor There's a silence hanging over everyone looking at these scenes. A few weeks ago, there were about 5,000 prisoners here and the noise must have been a constant cacophony of desperation.

Then spontaneously they pull out prayer mats and drop to their knees to pray for the thousands who lost so many years of their lives here.

""They put me in a room alone for a month and made the cell very cold. Now I'm mentally sick and my mind is not working well… in the two-and-a-half years I was held here, a lot of damage was done to my head."" He tells us he was a farmer when he was seized. ""Why were you arrested?"" I ask. ""Because I'm a Muslim,"" he replies, smiling. We may never know the specifics of what any of them were accused of now but that assessment - which is now widespread in Afghanistan - is a dangerous one to be held against the coalition forces. The Bagram detention facility may end up being known as one of the most successful recruitment centres for anti-Western terror networks."

""I think of the threat of antisemitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere,"" the pope said at an ecumenical meeting of Christian and Jewish leaders in the capital, Budapest. ""This is a fuse that must not be allowed to burn. And the best way to defuse it is to work together, positively, and to promote fraternity,"" he said. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Francis, on his first international outing since he had intestinal surgery in July, spent seven hours in Budapest, where he presided over a lengthy Mass for a crowd that organizers said reached 100,000 people, before he moved on to a four-day tour of neighboring Slovakia. He met briefly with Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, whose hard-line policies on refugees clash with Francis'. The pope has previously said migrants and refugees seeking better lives in Europe should be welcomed. He has also criticized what he has called ""national populism"" advanced by governments like Hungary's. Hungarian government posters saying ""Don't let George Soros have the last laugh"" on a train station wall in Budapest in July 2017. Laszlo Balogh / Reuters file Orbán, who has been in power since 2010, upset Hungary's Jewish community in 2017 when he used an image of the U.S. financier George Soros, who is Jewish, in an anti-immigration campaign. At the time, he rejected calls from the Jewish community to take the posters down. Under Orbán's leadership, Hungary approved a law to force a university founded by Soros out of the country, despite widespread condemnation at home and abroad. Orbán had claimed that Central European University violated regulations in awarding diplomas, an allegation the school rejected. Orbán was also widely criticized for his comments at rally in March 2018, when he told supporters: ""We are fighting an enemy that is different from us. ... Not open, but hiding; not straightforward, but crafty; not honest, but base; not national, but international; does not believe in working, but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland, but feels it owns the whole world."" Orbán has repeatedly rejected accusations of antisemitism. He said in May that they were ""ridiculous,"" and he said Hungary was a ""more than fair and correct country in that respect,"" Reuters reported. Orbán has also maintained that Jews should feel safe under his government, which he said has ""zero tolerance"" for antisemitism. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's refugee policies clash with the pope's. John Thys / Pool via Reuters file After the meeting, Orbán wrote on Facebook that he had asked the pope ""not to let Christian Hungary perish."" Ira Forman, a senior adviser for combating antisemitism at Human Rights First, said in a phone interview Sunday that he believes Orbán's past comments were clearly antisemitic. ""Orbán's a smart guy. He knows his history, and yes, he knew what he was doing,"" he said. ""The whole Soros campaign was chockablock with antisemitic allusions."" Gabor Kalman, the president of the Bet Orim Reform Jewish Congregation in Hungary, who attended Sunday's meeting with Francis, said he does not believe Orbán is responsible for fueling antisemitism in Hungary. While he said he does believe antisemitism is a growing problem, he said: ""I am convinced, and the leadership of my congregation also believe, that antisemitism doesn't stem from the current leadership."" Rather, he said, he believes it is a prejudice that has been passed down for generations in Hungarian society at the community level. In May, Human Rights Watch warned of an increase in reported hate incidents from Jews in many European countries. The organization said Jews in Europe were feeling ""increasingly unsafe"" in the swirl of reports of synagogues' being defaced and attacked. The Anti-Defamation League also recorded a surge in verbal and physical attacks against Jews in North America, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa after an outbreak of fighting between Israel and Gaza's militant Hamas rulers this year."

Video journalist Nemat Naqdi and video editor Taqi Daryabi from the Afghan online news outlet EtilaatRoz said they were detained while covering a women's protest against Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and in support of women's rights that took place on Wednesday. The protest was outside a police station, and Naqdi and Daryabi said they were taken inside the station and severely beaten. ""They were hitting me with extreme force that I really thought that this was the end of my life,"" Naqdi told CNN on Friday. ""They have hit me on my arm with extreme force that I could not move it during the last two days ... it has got better. My left eye has been hurt seriously that it is still red, and I am worried, my left ear can't receive any hearing. It has a buzzing noise. I was given four or five very hard slaps on my face."" ""They stepped on my head on the other side and they were pressing their foot on my head, my face was on the mosaic floor, and I was trying to pull myself due to the pain and to tell them to hit me on all sides and not just hit me on my back. For that reason, my face was bloodied,"" Naqdi said. ""They were using such violence that one was holding me by my head and face and another one was holding me by my waist. My hands and feet were tied and one of them was pushing my legs like a sling. I had a feeling that my neck may break, or my back may break,"" Naqdi added. ""When the Taliban forces arrested us and took us to the police station, they continuously tortured me for approximately 10 minutes even though I was not in state to remember the exact time. They hit me with whatever they could grab hold of,"" Daryabi said. ""It is possible that from now on the Taliban threaten and torture journalists. The continuation of their activities will be deemed as a danger to their government,"" Daryabi added. ""They declared to the journalists in a press conference that they will be granted permission to continue with their activities but only under the Islamic rules. I believe those threats are still present. The journalists will not stop, they are a different sector of the society, and they are people who convey the voice of the population,"" Daryabi added. ""They become the voice of the people."" CNN has reached out to the Taliban but has not received a comment at the time of this writing. Zaki Daryabi, Editor-in-Chief of EtilaatRoz, told CNN he hoped that ""in the first step, the Taliban leadership would respond to this continuous and brutal torture of our colleagues; and they would reprimand those who had committed this crime and act of torture in police district three; they would subject them to [legal] prosecution."" ""Secondly, we expected the Afghan and international media not to present this as an attack on EtilaatRoz [daily]; to present is as an attack on all media and discussion of freedom of expression,"" Zaki Daryabi added. Nemat Naqdi and Taqi Daryabi were among at least 14 journalists detained over the course of two days while covering protests in Kabul, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). At least six of the journalists ""were subject to violence during their arrests or detention,"" according to CPJ. ""The Taliban must immediately cease detaining journalists in Afghanistan, end the use of violence against them, and allow the media to operate freely and without fear of reprisal,"" CPJ said in a statement. The protests took place in the Dasht-i-Barchi area of Kabul, mostly inhabited by people from the minority Shia Hazara ethnic group known to have been targeted by the Taliban in the past. Some protesters were also detained but it is not yet clear how many. Witnesses have estimated the crowds at the protests at between 300 and 500 -- some of the largest demonstrations since the Taliban took control of Kabul.44"

Within hours, Mr Sittichai was on Facebook selling freshly picked kratom leaves, sourced from his neighbourhood in southern Thailand, to local consumers. Popular in the United States, where advocates say it is an opioid alternative, but critics say it is a dangerous drug, kratom is the latest herb the Thai government has legalised for production. Though producers can sell only domestically for now, Thailand has plans to allow exports, potentially enabling local dealers to become suppliers to the US, the world's most lucrative market. ""A lot of the older villagers kept kratom trees to harvest and eat its leaves,"" Mr Sittichai, 31, said. ""After it became legal, I started collecting and buying the leaves to help them earn extra income."" Already, the domestic response has been overwhelming: One week after Mr Sittichai launched, he stopped advertising because orders were coming in faster than villagers could harvest the crop. Still, Thai consumers have many options on social media platforms like Facebook and e-commerce outlets like Shopee, where hundreds of new posts offer stacks of fresh leaves for roughly 100 baht (S$4.10) per 100g. Thailand removed kratom from the narcotics list on Aug 24, and on Sept 8, lawmakers passed a draft law to allow kratom imports and exports. The moves followed an easing of rules against cannabis and hemp. Thailand lags Indonesia as a producer of the coffee-like shrub, which has leaves that advocates say can kill pain, boost energy and treat depression and high blood pressure. Thailand had banned its cultivation, consumption or sale, and people convicted of possessing any part of the plant faced hefty fines and lengthy prison sentences. Thailand's local kratom market could be worth 600 million baht by next year, based on assumptions that the sector will be smaller than the hemp industry, said Mr Chaiwat Sowcharoensuk, an analyst at Krungsri Research. Once Thailand announces rules to regulate trade and large-scale companies join the green rush, though, the export market could be significantly larger, he added. ""Decriminalisation will not only benefit farmers, but will also create a whole new supply chain from upstream to downstream and will likely attract operators looking to turn it into beverages, health supplements and cosmetics,"" Mr Chaiwat said. US market The biggest potential export market is the US, where online dealers now sell Indonesia-sourced kratom powder and other products to consumers looking for alternatives to opioids. The US market is estimated to be valued at more than US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) annually, with 11 million to 15 million users, according to the American Kratom Association, which based its valuation on imports from Indonesia. ""We expect that the legalisation of kratom in Thailand will lead to more acceptance of this botanical, and, in turn, reasonable regulations for growing and processing in the countries where kratom is cultivated,"" said Ms Jenn Lauder, director of marketing and advocacy at Kraken Kratom, an Oregon-based vendor that sells products from strains local to Indonesia and Thailand. ""This means that companies in the US could have greater control over their supply chains, including seed-to-sale tracking and quality assurance standards that start at the source, and more consistent raw plant materials,"" she added.  A farmer tending to a kratom plant on a farm in Nonthaburi, Thailand, on Feb 2, 2021. PHOTO: AFP  The timing of the liberalisation is awkward. The World Health Organisation's Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, which evaluates the potential harm of psychoactive substances, next month will begin what it calls a pre-review of kratom, the first step in a process that could lead to tighter controls. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers about kratom. ""There is substantial concern regarding the safety of kratom, the risk it may pose to public health and its potential for abuse,"" Ms Judy McMeekin, its Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, said in a May statement. Advocates say the criticism is unfair. ""Kratom may be much more beneficial than harmful to society, and, if properly regulated, can help with certain addictions, help those struggling with acute and chronic pain, and offer those who are trapped in the opioid addiction cycle a safe path away from that,"" said Mr Mac Haddow, senior fellow on public policy at the American Kratom Association. In Thailand, decriminalisation is getting good reviews from people like Ms Phatcharaphon Thupaphong, a 47-year-old caddie who chews kratom to get an energy boost while working under the tropical sun. ""Before it became legal, I'd have to hide the leaves under my car seat, and they'd shrivel from the heat by the time I got home,"" she said. ""Now, I don't have to worry."""

The blaze in Malaga province has destroyed nearly 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of forest and prompted fresh evacuations, bringing the total number of residents displaced to around 2,500. Plan Infoca, the Andalusia region's agency in charge of firefighting efforts, described Sunday as a ""key day"" for bringing the blaze under control. Authorities on Sunday preventively removed nearly 1,500 residents from the towns of Jubrique, Genalguacil and four other villages. Over 1,000 other people had been evacuated before the weekend from areas around the resort town of Estepona, which is popular among tourists and foreign expats. An emergency brigade traveled from the military base of Moron, in southern Spain, to join more than 300 firefighters and 41 water-dropping aircraft battling the flames. The reinforcement was welcomed. But firefighters like Rafael Fanega, who said the blaze was still ""out of control,"" called for more boots on the ground to battle the flames. ""I don't see enough deployed personnel,"" Fanega told The Associated Press, speaking in Jubrique after it was evacuated. ""Some may see it differently, but that's how I see it."" Some progress was seen on Saturday, when authorities said better weather conditions had helped them stabilize the perimeter of the blaze, allowing them to focus on four hot spots. A combination of hot and dry temperatures with strong winds created a perfect storm, turning the blaze that started late Wednesday into a ""hungry monster,"" Alejandro Garcia, deputy operational chief of Plan Infoca, said earlier this week. ""The potency and strength of this wildfire is unusual for the kind of blazes that we are used to seeing in this country,"" Garcia told reporters Sunday. The firefighting agency released aerial pictures showing towering plumes of smoke emerging from rugged terrain, which it said made crews' access on the ground difficult. A 44-year-old firefighter died Thursday while trying to extinguish the blaze. Authorities said they have evidence of arson and are investigating. Wildfires are common in southern Europe during the hot, dry summer months. But have been particularly numerous around the Mediterranean Sea this year, worsened by the intense August heat waves. In Spain, over 75,000 hectares (186,000 acres) of forest and bush areas have burned in the first eight months of the year, according to Spain's Ministry of Ecological Transition. Climate scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms."

It will interact with a strong easterly wind anomaly high over the tropics. This interaction happens every few years and has actually brought colder winters to Europe and the United States in the past. Before explaining what is coming for the Polar Vortex and our Winter weather, we will quickly learn what exactly is the Polar Vortex. We try to explain this in most of our winter articles, as knowledge is essential and powerful, so why not learn something new very quickly along the way.  AS THE NORTH POLE COOLS… In essence, the polar vortex is like a large cyclone, that forms when the stratosphere over the North Pole starts to cool down. The image below shows an example of the pressure pattern in the lower stratosphere, with the Polar Vortex covering the Polar Regions and down into the mid-latitudes. But what exactly is this “stratosphere”? All of the clouds (and the weather that we feel) are found in the lowest layer of the atmosphere called the troposphere. It reaches up to around 8 km (5 miles) altitude over the polar regions and up to around 14-16 km (9-10 miles) over the tropics. Above it, there is a much deeper layer called the stratosphere. It is a very dry layer, around 30km thick. This is where the ozone layer is. You can see the layers of the atmosphere on the image below, with the troposphere on the bottom and the Stratosphere with the ozone layer above it. When you hear people talk about the polar vortex and its influence, 90% of the time they talk about the higher altitude stratospheric part. While the stratospheric polar vortex is spinning high above our weather (tho strongly connected), it plays a major role in the developing winter weather patterns across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Every year as we head into autumn, the north pole starts to cool down. But the atmosphere further south is still relatively warm as it continues to receive energy from the Sun. This temperature difference causes a pressure drop over the polar regions. As the temperature and pressure drop over the pole and the temperature difference towards the south increases, a large low-pressure (cyclonic) area will start to intensify across the Northern Hemisphere. The same process happens in the stratosphere, creating a large anti-clockwise spinning system. The image below shows a typical example of the Polar Vortex at around 46km altitude (1mb level) near the top of the stratosphere. You can see that the polar vortex really is like a very large cyclone, covering the whole north pole down to the mid-latitudes. It is strongly present at all levels, from the ground up, but in different shapes. The next image below will show you the temperature at around 5km altitude, revealing the true shape and size of the polar vortex closer to the ground (cold colors). The closer to the ground we get, the more deformed the polar vortex gets, due to the growing influence of the terrain and the many weather fronts and systems. You can see on the image above what the true extent of the polar vortex looks like at lower altitudes in Winter. Be aware of its “arms” extending into eastern and western United States, also bringing along colder air into the region in early February 2021, which is the date of the image. For an even better idea, we produced a high-resolution video for you below, which very nicely shows the Polar Vortex spinning over the Northern Hemisphere at around 5km altitude. In the video, you can see the temperature at this altitude, as the temperature nicely shows the actual size and shape of the complex structure of the Polar Vortex at lower altitudes. POLAR VORTEX 2021/2022 Currently, the temperature is already dropping in the stratosphere. The image below shows the temperature difference forecast in the next two weeks, in the middle stratosphere. We can see the large-scale cooling over the majority of the North Pole. Looking at the actual temperature forecast, we can see a nice cold-core starting to develop over the Polar Circle. This is the heart of the Polar Vortex, as the colder it gets, the stronger the polar vortex can become. That is because it feeds off the temperature/pressure difference between the polar and the southern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The pressure is also starting to drop rapidly. The image below shows the geopotential height of 10mb level (~30km altitude), we can see the smaller low-pressure area starting to develop over the Arctic Circle. That is the foundation for the polar vortex of the upcoming winter 2021/2022. Towards late September, shown on the forecast image below, we can see the polar vortex is much more developed, and rapidly increasing in size and influence. As the pressure drops in the polar vortex, this increases its wind speed. The stronger it gets, the easier it is to influence our weather down at the surface. Speaking of wind, the current forecast shows the stratospheric jet stream developing. This is also called the Polar Night Jet. The image below shows the stratospheric jet stream in the upper stratosphere at 1mb level (~45km/28mi altitude) Looking at the 10mb level (~30km/18.5mi altitude) forecast, we can see the stratospheric jet stream at this level. It has a nice oval shape and is already almost connected across the entire Northern Hemisphere. The strength of the stratospheric jet stream at the 10mb level is usually used to determine the strength of the polar vortex and its potential influence on weather in the winter when it is at its strongest. Current forecasts, when compared to the long-term average, show that the late September strength of the polar vortex is likely to be higher than usual. That is seen in the image below which shows the forecast of the stratospheric jet stream at 10mb (~30km), compared to the long-term average (yellow line). This might not mean much for now, but it shows that the polar vortex is having a more energetic start than usual so far. Graphic by Simon Lee. We can also take a look at the vertical pressure profile, to see what are the expected changes in the lower levels. The first image shows the analysis for Sept.11th. This image basically shows the pressure anomalies with altitude over the Polar regions. Currently, we can see a stronger low-pressure area in the upper stratosphere, extending down, but nothing major. Looking at the 10-day forecast, we can see that the direct connection between the higher stratosphere and the lower atmosphere is not there. This is partially due to strong pressure systems across the Northern Hemisphere. Looking ahead, the connection looks to be re-established in late September. Low-pressure anomalies look to connect down from the higher levels of the stratosphere. Looking at the corresponding longitude, we can actually find the connection area at the surface. For that, we will use the pressure anomaly forecast. Note that this is a 16-day forecast and will change completely. But it serves as a good example. We can see a deeper low-pressure system over the Arctic ocean, down to 975mb. This is the main connecting spot of the stratospheric polar vortex and the surface pressure patterns. But polar vortex is just one part of the overall Winter 2021/2022 story. You will now see another major factor that we mentioned in the intro, the strong wind anomaly high over the tropics. That anomaly is called the Quasi-biennial Oscillation, also known as the “Heartbeat of the Atmosphere”. First, we need to look at the winds over the entire planet, from the south pole to the north pole. We produced a unique image below, which is quite simple to read. It shows the forecast of west-to-east (zonal) winds over the entire earth, from the south pole (-90°), over the Equator (0°) to the north pole (90°). Positive values indicate westerly winds, while negative values indicate easterly winds. The graphic shows the winds from the surface up to around 60-65km/37-40mi altitude. We have marked a few areas of interest, that really stand out.   Black box: This shows the very strong stratospheric jet stream over the southern hemisphere. This is currently associated with a strong stratospheric polar vortex over the South Pole. We can see its connection down to the tropospheric jet stream, directly influencing the weather. Violet box : Here we have our own stratospheric jet stream developing over the northern hemisphere. It is not nearly as strong as the one over the south pole, but it is in its early stages, and will keep getting stronger all the way towards the end of December 2021. Blue box : This is the “regular” jet stream as we know it, in the troposphere, at around 8-10km/5-6mi altitude. We can see that it is not very strong yet, as it is just entering its Fall mode. We can also see that it is not yet connected fully with the main stratospheric jet stream. Red box : This is the only strong area of negative values (easterly winds). It is more important then it might look at first. This shows the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) above the Equator, a regular shift in wind direction from west to east. EQUATORIAL WINDS AND WINTER WEATHER  The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation(QBO short), is a regular variation of the winds high above the equator. Strong winds in the stratosphere travel in a belt around the planet, and around every 14 months, these winds completely change direction. This means that every year or so winds high above the equator change from west to east. A wind analysis below for the 30mb level (~24km/15mi), shows this easterly wind stream above the tropical regions. It is currently in negative values, which reveals that easterly winds are prevalent. This means that the QBO is in the east mode. We can see these west and east phases in a quite simple image. Below we see the zonal (W-E) winds in the stratosphere above the equator over time. It is obvious right away that this is a very regular shift from west winds (positive values) to the easterly winds (negative values). Notice how each phase is descending slowly over time. This shift from west to east winds is so regular, that it gave QBO the nickname “heartbeat of the atmosphere“. Each phase slowly descends down over time, from the middle stratosphere around 10mb (~30km/18.5mi) down to the top of the troposphere around 100mb (~17-18km/11mi). Below we have a special graph, that shows the zonal wind anomalies for the past 40 years at around 24km/15mi altitude. It nicely shows just regularly this wind shift really is, like watching a heart pulse. Looking more closely at the past 3 years, we can see how each phase descends over time. A west phase in 2019, a weak negative in 2020, followed by a positive last winter, and the new negative descending down for Winter 2021/2022. The image below is from NASA analysis.  If we look specifically at 2021 alone, there is a very obvious fast descent of the easterly winds. It accelerated in early Spring and continued all to today. Currently, it is holding its level, not descending further, which is a typical occurrence. It will continue to descend during Winter 2021/2022, being replaced by a westerly phase in 2022. A radiosonde analysis from Singapore also shows the wind direction above the tropics. It reveals the easterly winds around the 10-50mb level, confirming the east QBO phase will be dominant this winter. The QBO is an important part of weather development in winter, as it can affect the North Atlantic jet stream. The speed of the winds in the Atlantic jet stream weakens and strengthens with the direction change of the QBO. The jet stream is an important atmospheric feature that brings us our weather, and the risk of winter conditions across the Northern Hemisphere can differ depending on the phase of the QBO. When the QBO is easterly, there is an increased chance of a weak jet stream, sudden stratospheric warming events, and colder winters in Northern and Central Europe and the United States. When the QBO is westerly, the chance of a strong jet, a mild winter, winter storms, and heavy rainfall increases. The image below shows the correlation between the QBO and surface temperatures in the Winter season. More specifically, this shows the signal for the easterly QBO which we will have this Winter. We can see a tendency for colder temperatures over the southern and eastern United States, and over Europe. The signal is not so strong, however, as there are a lot of other “winter influencers” out there. There is more than one reason why QBO can influence our Winter weather. One very important aspect is of course the Polar Vortex, which is why we mentioned QBO in this article in the first place. The image below shows the connection between the east QBO and the Polar Vortex in the December-January winter period. We can see a signal for a higher pressure over the polar stratosphere, which indicates a weaker Polar Vortex. That is usually associated with a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events. These are very powerful weather events that occur high up in the Polar stratosphere, but usually come crashing down, impacting the weather across the entire Northern Hemisphere.  POLAR VORTEX AND WINTER WEATHER  Simplified, a Sudden Stratospheric Warming event (SSW) is exactly what the name suggests. It is a sudden temperature rise in the polar stratosphere during winter. Warming of the stratosphere means that the polar vortex is weakened, and can also collapse under the pressure from the warming event. The source of the warming usually comes from the bottom up, as strong weather patterns can actually deflect a lot of energy upwards into the stratosphere, disrupting its dynamics. A strong polar vortex usually locks the cold air into the Polar region, creating milder winters for most of the United States and Europe. A Polar Vortex collapse is just as dynamic as it sounds, as the higher pressure comes crashing down, pushing the cold air out of the polar regions, into the United States and/or Europe. This creates a chain reaction, which can disrupt the jet stream, and creates high pressure over the Arctic circle, releasing the cold arctic air into Europe and the United States. An SSW event is usually triggered by specific massive pressure patterns in the troposphere, which can send a lot of energy upwards vertically into the stratosphere. Below we have example images from the great SSW analysis siteat ESRL/NOAA, which shows two examples of winters with an SSW event. The winter of 1984/1985 and the winter of 2008/2009. The top row shows the stratospheric conditions, with warming anomalies, and a polar vortex split into two parts. The bottom row shows the surface temperature anomalies, following these events, with the very cold winter in 1985 and cooler weather after the 2009 SSW event.   Looking closer at the 2009 warming event, we can see the stratospheric warming (red colors) as it slowly progressed downwards over time. It eventually connected with the surface, raising pressure over the North Pole, and releasing the colder air into western and central Europe and the northern United States.   If we combine all Stratospheric Warming events and look at the weather 0-30 days following the stratospheric warming events, we get an interesting picture. We can see below that the pressure usually rises above the Polar regions, and drops over Europe and the western Atlantic.   Below we have the corresponding temperature 0-30 days after an SSW event. Most of the United States is trending colder than normal, and also Europe, with the exception of the southeast parts. Note: this is an average picture of many SSW events. Each individual stratospheric warming event is different and does not automatically mean a strong winter pattern.   To see a practical example, look no further than last winter. We witnessed strong stratospheric warming this year in early January, which was during a west QBO, and might come as a very slight surprise, as negative (east) QBO is usually more favorable for such an event. On January 5th, the preliminary date of the Sudden Stratospheric Warming event was marked, as the winds around the polar circle have reversed. The stratospheric warming wave has crawled over the entire North Pole in the stratosphere, effectively splitting the cold-core of the polar vortex into two parts. One part of the broken polar vortex has moved over North America and one over the European sector. At this point, this does not have much to do directly with the winter weather on the surface, since this is at a 30km altitude. But the weather influence followed quite soon after. The strength of the polar vortex is usually measured by the power of the winds it produces. This is done is by measuring the zonal (west to east moving) wind speeds around the polar circle (60°N latitude). We can track this stratospheric warming event by looking at the temperature and wind speeds. Below we have an analysis graph from the NASA monitoring system, where you can see a very interesting progression in the 2020/2021 Winter Season. In early December, the polar vortex was at a strong level, reaching over 40m/s (90mph) zonal wind speeds. Towards mid-month, and especially towards late December, the polar vortex began to weaken. We can see the stratospheric zonal winds became negative in early January, due to the warming event that collapsed the polar vortex. Looking at the NASA temperature analysis for the polar stratosphere, we can see the large temperature spike at the 10mb (30km) level. This shows a strong warming event, with temperatures staying above normal for weeks after. Rapid cooling began in early February, as the polar vortex recovered some of its strength. When trying to find a connection between the stratosphere and our winter weather, it helps to have more specialized images at hand. Especially one that shows altitude and time. The image below shows an atmospheric pressure index. Negative values indicate lower pressure (blue colors) and positive values indicate higher pressure (red colors). We have altitude from the ground up to the top of the stratosphere (~46km/28mi) for the Winter/Spring 2021 period. You can see strong positive values in the stratosphere in early January, associated with the higher pressure buildup during the stratospheric warming event. The event and/or its influence was slowly descending over time, reaching the lower levels by mid and late January. This persisted well into February, influencing the weather circulation even when the stratospheric warming was already over. We produced an analysis image of the January-February 2021 winter period, showing pressure and temperature anomalies. The first image below shows the pressure anomalies, where you can see a strong high-pressure system dominating the North Pole. This dominant high-pressure system originated from the stratospheric warming event and the polar vortex collapse, as we showed in the image above. A strong high-pressure system over the Arctic can heavily disrupt the weather circulation and can unlock the cold air from the Arctic regions towards the mid-latitudes. The image below shows the temperature anomalies in January-February 2021 period. Warmer than normal temperatures were present under the high-pressure system over the polar regions. But cold Arctic air was pushed out heavily into Siberia, and also into western Canada and the south-central United States.   SUMMARY  We now know what the polar vortex is and what the QBO is. The QBO is found in the stratosphere above the equator and is connected to the global large-scale circulation. The west or east phase of the QBO can have a different effect on the polar vortex and the development of a Stratospheric Warming event. In most cases, the east phase of the QBO is more favorable for a better winter pattern in the United States and Europe. We have also discussed the La Nina phase of the ENSO and its influence in our Fall forecast 2021, so check it out for more details on what exactly is the La Nina and the ENSO cycle. Historically, a La Nina winter has around 60-75% chance of producing a stratospheric warming event. It has produced them in the past and also in the last winter. Below we have the ENSO forecast from BoM Australia, which shows the La Nina phase for late Fall and through the Winter 2021/2022. Without a stratospheric warming event, a La Nina winter can generally be milder in Europe and the United States. But combined with a negative QBO, it can change the weather patterns. This is why the state of the stratospheric polar vortex is important, as well as the phase of the QBO. Current signals show the potential for a stratospheric warming event in mid-winter, based on current parameters. A lot depends on the positioning of the massive high and low-pressure systems in the North Pacific. This is where other short-term factors also come into play, like weekly weather variability, tropical convection, ocean temperature anomalies, etc… We will soon take an early look at the first model winter forecast for Winter 2021/2022. We will further analyze the current state of the oceans and the atmosphere, and what are the expected scenarios, based on the latest model forecasts.

Japan and Vietnam have agreed to step up cooperation amid worries about China’s growing military influence, signing a new deal that enables the export of Japanese-made defence equipment and technology to Hanoi. Japan’s Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said the deal, signed on Saturday, elevates the two countries’ defence partnership “to a new level” and that Japan and Vietnam plan to deepen defence ties through multinational joint exercises and other means. Details about the transfer of specific equipment, including naval vessels, will be worked out in subsequent talks, the Japanese Defence Ministry said in a statement. Kishi’s meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Phan Van Giang, in Hanoi coincided with a two-day visit to the Vietnamese capital by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Chinese diplomat wrapped up his visit by saying Beijing plans to donate three million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to Vietnam. He also said China and Vietnam should refrain from any unilateral actions regarding the South China Sea that could complicate the situation and magnify disagreements. Vietnam has territorial disputes with China over the Spratly and Paracel island groups in the South China Sea. In a veiled reference to China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters, Japan’s Defence Ministry said Kishi and Giang agreed on the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as cooperation in various defence areas including cybersecurity. The ministry said Kishi expressed Japan’s strong opposition to “any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by coercion or any activities that escalate tensions”. Japan and China are also embroiled in a territorial dispute, with Tokyo regularly protesting against the Chinese coastguard’s presence in the East China Sea near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which Beijing also claims and calls Diaoyu. Japanese officials say Chinese vessels routinely violate Japanese territorial waters around the islands, sometimes threatening fishing boats. Vietnam is the 11th nation with which Japan has signed a defence equipment and technology transfer deal. Tokyo is looking to expand military cooperation beyond its longtime ally, the United States, and has signed similar agreements with the United Kingdom, Australia, the Philippines and Indonesia."

The communist island of 11.2 million people aims to inoculate all its children before reopening schools that have been closed for the most part since March 2020. The new school year started on Sept 6 (2021), but from home via television programmes, as most Cuban homes do not have internet access. Having completed clinical trials on minors with its Abdala and Soberana vaccines, Cuba kicked off its inoculation campaign for children on Sept 3 (2021), starting with those 12 and older. On Sept 6 (2021), it started distributing jabs in the two to 11 age group in the central province of Cienfuegos. Several other countries in the world are vaccinating children from the age of 12, and some are conducting trials in younger kids. Countries such as China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have announced they plan to vaccinate younger children, but Cuba is the first to do so. Chile on Sept 6 (2021) approved the Sinovac vaccine for children between six and 12. The Cuban vaccines – the first developed in Latin America – have not undergone international scientific peer review. They are based on recombinant protein technology – the same used by the United States’ Novavax and France’s Sanofi jabs, which are both awaiting WHO approval. Unlike many other shots in use, recombinant vaccines do not require extreme refrigeration. The majority of schools in Cuba have been closed since March 2020, reopening for a few weeks at the end of last year before closing again in January (2021). The government has announced schools will reopen gradually in October and November (2021), but only after all children have been vaccinated. The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) has called for schools worldwide to reopen as soon as possible, as “the long-term costs of closures are too high and hard to justify”. Cuba has seen an explosion in SARS-CoV-2 infections in recent months, putting pressure on its health system. Of the 5,700 coronavirus deaths recorded since the outbreak started, nearly half were in the last month (August 2021) alone, as were almost a third of all reported cases. – AFP Relaxnews"

The Taliban ""had sufficient revenues to run an insurgency,"" not a government, said Ajmal Ahmady. Local businesses could be hit as inflation grows and cash dries up. 10 Things in Politics: The latest in politics & the economy Loading Something is loading. Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy A ""triple shock"" to Afghanistan's economy could leave local businesses scrambling for a future as the country moves toward an economic crisis, says its most recent central bank chief. First, there was a regional drought. Then the COVID-19 pandemic. And now the Taliban takeover, Ajmal Ahmady said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council on Friday. He said the Taliban ""had sufficient revenues to run an insurgency but not to run a government."" As the Taliban began the difficult task of taking over a broken and broke government, former insiders and outside observers said the local economy was perhaps days away from ruin. The central bank was running low on funds, without support or access to its reserves from outside the country. The local currency, the afghani, was at risk of a sharp decline. And locals were struggling to figure out how local Taliban rules would affect their businesses. ""I don't want to say economic collapse, but I think it's going to be [an] extremely challenging or difficult economic situation,"" Ahmady said, predicting that GDP would shrink by 10-20%. The economy in Afghanistan is cash-based, especially for local businesses. As citizens find it increasingly difficult to access cash and savings, these businesses are expected to suffer. Joseph Fleming, a managing director at Straife, which provides risk-advisory services, is a former lobbyist for Pakistan who has done business in Afghanistan and the surrounding region. He told Insider: ""Certainly, local businesses that relied on services to NGOs and direct foreign aid recipients will likely be affected, but the average local business will be far more affected by the ongoing collapse of the afghani."" Perhaps adding to the sting were the reports that former President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani had taken millions of dollars in government funds when he fled the city last month. Ghani this week denied the reports, saying: ""My wife and I have been scrupulous in our personal finances."" Money changers in Kabul's Sarai Shahzada market. Wali Sabawoon/AP Photo But he also acknowledged that Afghanistan had long struggled with officials who took their own share of government funds. Most of which came from foreign governments or international aid groups. ""Corruption is a plague that has crippled our country for decades and fighting corruption has been a central focus of my efforts as president,"" he said in a message posted on Twitter. ""I inherited a monster that could not easily or quickly be defeated."" From an international perspective, it seemed clear that China had an interest in doing business with the Taliban, said Peter C. Earle, of the American Institute of Economic Research. It was likely that Beijing's acceptance of the Taliban — setting it apart in the international community — would amount to a first step toward helping the Taliban mine the ""considerable mineral wealth"" in the Afghani mountains and elsewhere, he said. The country has a range of natural resources, from gold and oil to rare elements like lithium. But unlocking the wealth of those resources could take a long time. ""Once a vein or lode worth mining is discovered, the retrieval process is extremely capital intensive and may take even more years to become productive,"" he said. ""If the Taliban is hostile to outsiders and/or shows an ambivalence toward property rights, the pool of interested mining and excavation partners will rapidly dwindle."" Fleming said the US withdrawal may have created ""the deal of a lifetime"" for China. But for local businesses, the future was still hazy. The local currency will also be hard to obtain, partly because afghani printing facilities are limited, Ahmady said. ""Inflation will definitely rise,"" he added."

The pope arrived in Hungary early on Sunday for an unusually short visit underlining differences with his political opposite, nationalist and anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orban. read more More than half a million Hungarian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, which destroyed a once-vibrant culture across the country. Today, there are about 75,000 to 100,000 Jews in Hungary, the largest number in central Europe, according to the World Jewish Congress, with most of them in Budapest. ""I think of the threat of anti-Semitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere,"" the pope said in an ecumenical meeting in Budapest with leaders of other Christian religions and Jews. ""This is a fuse that must not be allowed to burn. And the best way to defuse it is to work together, positively, and to promote fraternity,"" he said. A survey by the think tank Median commissioned by Mazsihisz, the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities, found that one in five Hungarians were strongly anti-Semitic, while another 16% were what the survey called moderately anti-Semitic. The survey, published in July and taken during 2019-2020, said there were fewer anti-Semitic acts such as vandalism and physical assault in Hungary compared with other European countries. In his speech, the pope evoked the image of Budapest's famous Chain Bridge over the Danube River, linking the two halves of the Hungarian capital, Buda and Pest. ""Whenever we were tempted to absorb the other, we were tearing down instead of building up. Or when we tried to ghettoize others instead of including them,"" the pope said. ""We must be vigilant and pray that it never happens again."" He said Christian leaders should commit to what he called an education in fraternity to stand up against outbursts of hatred. Orban, in power since 2010, had raised concerns in Hungary's Jewish community when several years ago he used an image of U.S. financier George Soros, who is Jewish, in an anti-immigration billboard campaign. In May, Orban told reporters that anti-Semitism accusations against him were ""ridiculous,"" adding that Hungary was a ""more than fair and correct country in that respect."" Orban has also said Jews should feel safe under his government and that Hungary would show ""zero tolerance"" for anti-Semitism. Reporting by Gergely Szakacs.

The agreement comes ahead of a key IAEA meeting on Monday -- and has been touted as a sign that the relationship between Iran and the IAEA is moving forward following its breakdown in the past few years. ""The parties recalled and reaffirmed the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust and its continuation and emphasized on the necessity of addressing the relevant issues in a constructive atmosphere and exclusively in a technical manner,"" said the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) Mohammad Eslami and IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi in a joint statement on Sunday. According to the statement, which followed the two chiefs' meeting in Tehran over the weekend, IAEA inspectors will be permitted to service the equipment and replace their storage media which will be kept under the joint IAEA and AEOI seals in the Islamic Republic. Iran has previously said it was planning to prevent the IAEA from reviewing video footage of some nuclear sites until there is an agreement to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany. Under the deal's terms, Iran had agreed to restrictions and international monitoring on its nuclear development, in return for sanctions relief. However, the deal has faltered since then-President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the pact in 2018. Read More"

Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, struck the deal in Tehran on Sunday after two hours of talks and will report to the IAEA’s board meeting on Monday. His breakthrough makes it less likely European states and the US will table a motion of censure against Iran that would have been passed to the UN security council. Grossi had been preparing to report to the IAEA that his ad hoc agreements to monitor the nuclear programme struck in February had in effect collapsed. Iran, now led by a new more hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi after elections in June, had been blocking a visit by Grossi, leaving European states little alternative from their perspective but to censure Iran. The head of the Iranian atomic energy association, Mohammad Eslami, said he had held constructive talks with Grossi and as a result new memory cards would be installed. The existing cards showing Iranian activity at its main nuclear sites will be kept in Iran under what is described as a joint seal. It has also been agreed the cameras can be serviced. No further details were given in the joint statement apart from that the two sides had reached an agreement on how this was to be done. Grossi will return to Tehran at a later date for what was described in a joint statement as “high-level consultations with the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran”. The talks will aim to revitalise what had previously been an intrusive inspections process. The Iranian parliament in February, putting pressure on the previous administration led by Hassan Rouhani, had ordered the government to withdraw from the agreement covering the UN inspections. This left the IAEA increasingly in the dark on how Iran was developing its nuclear programme. Tehran had admitted it was using more sophisticated centrifuges to a purity of 60%. The deal lets Iran produce enriched uranium but only at an underground plant at Natanz and only with first-generation IR-1 machines, which are far less efficient. It also caps the purity to which Iran can enrich uranium at 3.67%. Grossi said he would be returning to Iran for further talks to build trust between the IAEA and the new government. On his return to Vienna, Grossi said the agreement on servicing the IAEA cameras meant continuity of knowledge for his inspectors, which was about to be lost, would be retained even though his inspectors would not have immediate access to the film on the camera. He said: “We will be able to keep the information needed to maintain continuity of knowledge.” He added that the IAEA was “getting to the point where we needed immediate rectification, and this agreement gets us just that”. He described the agreement as a stopgap, but insisted it would be implemented within a few days. Admitting that over recent weeks “there had been a major communication breakdown with Iran”, he said his meeting on Sunday in Tehran also led to an understanding that there would be further, broader meetings with the new administration at higher levels in which he would be free to raise other long-standing issues, including unexplained nuclear particles found in some sites. “Nothing will be sidelined and nothing hidden,” he said. Tehran’s increasing brinkmanship had antagonised Russia, a natural ally, and also led to growing pressure on the US from Iran’s chief regional adversaries, Israel and Saudi Arabia, to admit the talks on the revival of the nuclear deal were at a dead end, thereby requiring a new more aggressive strategy. The US special envoy on Iran, Robert Malley, had held talks in Moscow and Paris last week ahead of the IAEA board meeting. The UK was represented at the Paris meeting by its former ambassador to Iran, Robert Macaire, an indication that the British diplomat is going to stay with the Iran file even though he left the embassy in the summer. A censure motion at the IAEA board meeting would have seriously jeopardised the stalled talks between the US and Iran on the US lifting most of its sanctions in return for clear Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal signed in 2015. Those talks have been on hold since Raisi’s election, partly because he needed to appoint a new negotiating team. The former Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has been replaced by Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, but there was little from Iran on whether it wanted to restart the negotiating strategy. The US claimed the talks had in principle reached a wide-ranging agreement on the lifting of sanctions, a move that would also lead to the release of as many as 10 dual-nationals."

The Korean Central News Agency said Monday the cruise missiles, which had been under development for two years, successfully hit targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away during flight tests on Saturday and Sunday. The North hailed its new missiles as a ""strategic weapon of great significance"" that meets leader Kim Jong Un's call to strengthen the country's military might, implying that they were being developed with an intent to arm them with nuclear warheads. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was analyzing the North Korean launches based on U.S. and South Korean intelligence. Kim during a congress of the ruling Workers' Party in January doubled down on his pledge to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of U.S. sanctions and pressure and issued a long wish list of new sophisticated assets, including longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, spy satellites and tactical nuclear weapons. Kim also said then that his national defense scientists were developing ""intermediate-range cruise missiles with the most powerful warheads in the world."" North Korea's weapons tests are meant to build a nuclear and missile program that can stand up to what it claims as U.S. and South Korean hostility, but they are also considered by outside analysts as ways to make its political demands clear to leaders in Washington and Seoul. The North's resumption of testing activity is likely an attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the the presidency of Donald Trump. North Korea ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, continuing a tradition of testing new U.S. administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at measuring Washington's response and wresting concessions. But there hadn't been any known test launches for months after that as Kim focused national efforts on fending off the coronavirus and salvaging his economy. KCNA said the missiles tested over the weekend traveled for 126 minutes ""along an oval and pattern-8 flight orbits"" above North Korean land and waters before hitting their targets. ""The test launches showed that the technical indices such as the thrust power of the newly developed turbine-blast engine, the missiles' navigation control and the end guided hit accuracy by the combined guided mode met the requirements of designs. In all, the efficiency and practicality of the weapon system operation was confirmed to be excellent,"" it said. It appeared that Kim wasn't in attendance to observe the tests. KCNA said Kim's top military official, Pak Jong Chon, observed the test-firings and called for the country's defense scientists to go ""all out to increase"" the North's military capabilities. Kim's powerful sister last month hinted that North Korea was ready to resume weapons testing while issuing a statement berating the United States and South Korea for continuing their joint military exercises, which she said was the ""most vivid expression of U.S. hostile policy."" She then said the North would boost its pre-emptive strike capabilities while another senior official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would leave the allies facing a ""security crisis."" The allies say the drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response to COVID-19. Talks between the United States and North Korea have stalled since the collapse of a summit between Trump and Kim in 2019, when the Americans rejected the North's demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Kim's government has so far rejected the Biden administration's overtures for dialogue, demanding that Washington abandon its ""hostile"" policies first. The latest tests came after Kim threw an unusual parade in capital Pyongyang last week that was a marked departure from past militaristic displays, showcasing anti-virus workers in hazmat suits and civil defense organizations involved in industrial work and rebuilding communities destroyed by floods instead of missiles and other provocative weaponry. Experts said that the parade was focused on domestic unity as Kim now faces perhaps his toughest test with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons, pandemic border closures that are causing further strain to its broken economy, and food shortages worsened by floods in recent summers."

Larry is now an extratropical storm, merging with the mid-latitude cyclone in the Labrador Sea. Both will generate a massive winter storm that is forecast to deliver a tremendous amount of snow across southeastern Greenland in the coming days. Hurricane Larry has made landfall in Newfoundland this Saturday around 4 UTC, near South East Bight. This was the first hurricane to make landfall in Newfoundland since Igor (2010). As hurricanes maintain their tropical (warm core) structure so far north are not so common, it makes Larry quite an interesting case. The landfall in Newfoundland was of a Category 1 strength. Soon after the landfall, Larry has moved quickly north-northeastward at about 42 knots and is now well northeast of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea, on its way towards Greenland. Although the hurricane still has some central convection, the low-and mid-level centers are separating, so the remaining convection is decreasing and should finish soon. The initial maximum winds are now around 65 knots and Larry has quickly transitioned into a powerful extratropical cyclone this Saturday evening. This Saturday, it has continued its speedy north-northeastward course, dissipating its tropical characteristics as it merged with a developing mid-latitude low over the Labrador Sea. The merging systems will lead to a massive winter storm over Greenland, producing a pretty rare event when a hurricane tracks far north in the Atlantic and pushes high tropical moisture towards the Arctic region. The result will be a lot of snow that is forecast to accumulate with this winter storm in the far North Atlantic region through Monday. The extratropical storm will remain pretty large and quite intense over the weekend while tracking northeast just north of Iceland with its center and gradually dissipate in the Greenland Sea early next week. The extratropical cyclone is one of the numerous types of low-pressure areas, that have the term “cyclone” The extratropical means that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropical region, generally in the mid-latitudes of Earth between 30° and 60° latitude (North or South). These systems are termed mid-latitude cyclones if they form within those latitudes, or post-tropical (extratropical) cyclones if a tropical cyclone (or a hurricane) has intruded into the mid-latitudes. This is exactly the case hurricane Larry made today. ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON IS AT ITS STATISTICAL PEAK, RUNNING AT 160% OF AN AVERAGE September 10th is the official statistical peak of the Atlantic Hurricane Season. So far, there have been 13 named storms, that’s about the average amount of tropical cyclones that occur by the end of a typical hurricane season. So the season is actually well ahead of the schedule. Through Sept 10th, there are normally about 8 named storms, so 2021 runs at 165% of the average. Basically, all the parameters we are usually looking at during the Atlantic hurricane season are well above average, including the number of hurricanes, major hurricanes, etc. Image is provided by dr. Philip Klotzbach. Hurricane Larry was the 12th named storm and also the longest-lived Atlantic hurricane this season, generated the highest ACE among all 13 storms in 2021. The ACE index – Accumulated Cyclone Energy is used to express the energy that was used during the tropical cyclone’s lifetime. We are monitoring this for any tropical region around the world. As of Sept 7th, more than 22 ACE has been accumulated by hurricane Larry. Far more than Hurricane Ida (10.82 ACE) or hurricane Elsa (9.52 ACE). Therefore the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season has already generated more Accumulated Cyclone Energy than 21 full Atlantic seasons in the satellite era (1966 onwards). While Larry is now an extratropical storm, it keeps adding some ACE as it tracks across the North Atlantic this weekend. In total, 74 ACE has accumulated through Sept 9th, about 135% of the long-term average (1991-2020). Once the storm merges with the mid-latitude cyclone, they both move across the Labrador Sea and approach the southern tip of Greenland by Sunday morning. Then, the large-scale system will continue tracking northeast towards Iceland, but its track will likely bring it in between the two lands. Accelerating across the Denmark Strait into the Greenland Sea early next week. The high moisture and large system will dump a huge amount of snow across southern Greenland starting Saturday night through Monday as the center of the extratropical storm tracks along the southeastern coast. EX-HURRICANE LARRY TRANSFORMS INTO AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW, DEVELOPS A MASSIVE WINTER STORM TO GREENLAND When a tropical storm or a hurricane loses warm sea (oceanic) water support for fueling the convective storms, it is transformed into an extratropical low. The main difference between a hurricane and a deep extratropical storm is in its core. While a hurricane (tropical cyclone) has a warm core structure, an extratropical storm has a cold core. So the extratropical storms are what we typically experience in the mid-latitudes. These cold-core systems have cold and warm fronts, the features we are mostly more familiar with. While the warm core systems (those can be hurricanes, typhoons, or even medicanes) produce weather features such as eyes, eyewalls, and spiral outer bands. It is actually quite a rare event that a hurricane survives so far north in the Atlantic, meaning that it keeps producing some convective storms and drags a very high amount of moisture that will normally interact with the lower temperatures, therefore have the potential to produce deep snow. Through Saturday night (image above), Larry interacts with the developing mid-latitude storm emerging over the Labrador Sea and together they deepened further. The strengthening low will help to pull in a huge amount of moisture from the warmer Atlantic Ocean towards Greenland. This will lead to a significant winter storm that is forecast to impact the southern parts of the country. The general model consensus is in good agreement that widespread snowfall totals of 50-100 cm, even more in some areas. Especially as strong orographic effects of the very moist air mass will develop extreme snowfall on the southeastern slopes of the mountainous terrain there. The higher the mountains are, more snow will accumulate and close to 150 cm over the next 72 hours is likely. The winter storm across southeastern Greenland will gradually be advancing northeast and spread across southeastern and eastern parts of the country through Sunday night into Monday. Also, Iceland should see some effects of the extratropical storm, but the colder side will remain over Greenland so snowfall in Iceland is not expected (only in the higher tops). The pressure gradient around the deep extratropical storm tracking along southeastern Greenland against the much higher pressure over the land further north will also develop very intense downslope winds in the system’s wake. Those wind gusts could be up to around 180 km/h in some areas, possibly more when channeling effects occur in the fjords of southern Greenland. The winter storm will be accompanied by an intense snow blizzard along southern and southeastern Greenland, so conditions will be pretty wild over the next 48-72 hours. However, the population in this part of Greenland is pretty sparse, so not many will be under the dangerous threat there. Only the southeastern parts of the country where some small towns are located. ***Images in this article were produced by Windy, and Weathernerds."

During the event late Wednesday, Kim, wearing a cream-colored suit and a shiny white tie, emerged as the clock struck midnight. He beamed in response to thunderous applause from performers and spectators filling Pyongyang's brightly illuminated Kim Il Sung Square, named after his grandfather, the country's founder.  He smiled widely, waved to the crowd and kissed children who presented him with flowers before taking his spot on a balcony to observe the parade. He laughed vigorously and applauded the marchers throughout the event, while holding animated chats with senior officials. It was a stark change from 2018, when TV footage showed him struggling to catch his breath while accompanying South Korean President Moon Jae-in on a short hike to North Korea's Mount Paektu during a period of diplomatic engagement. Moon, who is three decades older than Kim, didn't seemed fazed by the walk at all. North Korea leader Kim Jong Un attends a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9, 2021. KCNA/Reuters ""His face is clearly thinner and he is moving much more vigorously,"" said Park Won-gon, a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul's Ewha Womans University.  Kim's weight loss became noticeable in June, when he made his first public appearance in weeks to convene a ruling party meeting. Some North Korea watchers then said that Kim, who is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and has previously weighed 308 pounds, may have lost 22-44 pounds.  Most experts say Kim's weight loss is more likely a result of efforts to improve his shape than an indicator of health problems, considering his regular public activity. It may also have a political purpose.  Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade of rule, with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons, pandemic border closures that cause further strain to its broken economy, and food shortages made worse by floods in recent summers.  It has become crucial for Kim to build an image as a young and vigorous leader who can navigate the country out of trouble, analyst Park said. Such image-making efforts would align with the latest parade, which showcased civil defense units involved in efforts to rebuild the economy and communities destroyed by floods and emphasized a domestic message for unity. North Korea leader Kim Jong Un (C) attends a paramilitary parade held to mark the 73rd founding anniversary of the republic at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang in this undated image supplied by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on September 9, 2021. KCNA/Reuters Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Kim, with his weight loss and cheerful demeanor at the parade, is likely trying to project an image of a ""normal statesman"" who engages with the public. ""He's also a husband and a father of three children who is approaching his 40s, so it isn't strange that he would care about his health,"" Yang said.  Kim's health is the focus of keen outside attention as the 37-year-old leader hasn't publicly anointed a successor who would take control of North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal targeting Asian rivals and the American homeland. He has been known for heavy drinking and smoking and comes from a family with a history of heart problems. His father and grandfather, who ruled North Korea before him, both died of heart issues.  ""Considering the North's political system, where the supreme leader decides everything, Kim's health is an extremely important security matter,"" Park said. ""It's likely there were internal concerns that he was overweight, and it would have been important for Kim to reduce those concerns and present himself as a young and healthy leader who's capable of doing things."" Dr. Cheong Seong-Chang, Director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, told CBS News that Kim may also have wanted with the parade, to ""show the world that North Korea is safe from the coronavirus, as they have repeatedly said."""

In a statement sent to The Ubyssey, Matthew Ramsey, director of university affairs at UBC Media Relations, said that the fee was waived as a response to the extenuating circumstances being faced by certain prospective students who are applying to UBC from different countries. “UBC has a long standing policy to waive the application fee for applicants to graduate programs from countries that are listed on the United Nations least developed countries list,” said Ramsey. The fee is not only waived for those individuals who hold citizenship, but also those with a permanent address in Afghanistan. While it is difficult to measure the impact made by the fee waiver as of now, the intention of the waiver was to make UBC more accessible to Afghan students in their time of need. Other than the waiver, UBC has also taken other measures to help Afghans. Veterans Transition Network is a charity created by UBC’s faculty of education, which has helped over 1,275 veterans. Seventy-five students, staff and faculty at UBC are veterans or active-serving military who plan to extend support and mentorship to prospective Afghan students who are affected by the current conflict. Is the waiver a step in the right direction? In an interview with The Ubyssey, Dr. Naveena Naqvi, assistant professor of Persianate Islamic cultures of South Asia, said that UBC’s decision to waive the application fee “seems like it's a step in the right direction.” But Naqvi also spoke of other ways the UBC community can help Afghan students feel comfortable on and off campus. Along with that, Naqvi said that it is important to keep Afghan cultures alive on campus, such as Dari or Pashtun language-driven student clubs, so that students feel comfortable and at home. “We're just entering the university environment, and moving from one university culture to another is always a challenge, moving from one country to another is always a challenge… so faculty, students and administrators can be welcoming to people,” Naqvi said. Kimani Karangu, president of UBC’s Graduate Student Society, also commented on the waiver in a statement sent to The Ubyssey. “While this [waiver] will help those students intending to join, we must also think about those that are already in the system,” he said. Karangu said that an emergency trust fund could be set up by UBC for Afghan students, that could be accessed “to support their academics and life as they try to come to terms with the plight of their dislocated families.”"

Japan loosened regulations last year that required stores to have employees on staff. The country's labor shortage is set to intensify as the population continues to decline, and more businesses are moving to streamline operations using digital technology. Japan's labor productivity ranks the lowest among Group of Seven nations and only 21st among the 37 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Automation has become essential for retail, which lags other industries in improving productivity, but food sanitation laws required retail shops that handle food to have a sanitation supervisor on site. In June 2020, responding to repeated demands from retail industry groups for deregulation, the health and labor ministry said that sanitary control could be done by patrols. Payment systems are another important element of automated stores. FamilyMart will use ceiling cameras equipped with artificial intelligence cameras, as well as weight sensors on the shelves, to monitor which products a customer picks up. When customers stand in front of a payment terminal, the product names and prices are displayed on a monitor, and they pay electronically or with cash. The system removes the hassle of reading barcodes and makes it more difficult for customers to shoplift. To protect customer privacy, data that could lead to individual identification -- such as facial images -- will not be collected. Customers will not need to prepare a smartphone app in advance or provide biometric authentication when entering a store. FamilyMart said it will be able to offer virtually all of the roughly 3,000 items sold in its regular shops. A trial store opened in Tokyo during July was just 50 sq. meters, about 30% the size of a regular outlet. It used about 50 cameras and offered roughly 750 items. The ages of customers buying alcoholic beverages were verified through a monitor on the payment terminal. The company decided to start the large-scale expansion after confirming that the system operated without problems with about 10 customers in a store at once. The system uses the expertise of Tokyo-based Touch To Go, a company that develops technology for unstaffed stores. It is an affiliate of East Japan Railway, and FamilyMart also holds a stake. Opening an automated store costs about 20% more than a regular shop, but labor costs can be greatly reduced because employees are needed only to receive and stock merchandise. Labor accounts for 60% of operating expenses at franchise stores, a survey by the Japan Fair Trade Commission found. FamilyMart has about 16,000 stores in Japan, and the chain opens 200 to 500 new outlets yearly. New stores from this point on will be largely unstaffed. ""We'll be able to open stores in areas that have been unprofitable until now,"" President Kensuke Hosomi told Nikkei. ""We want to contribute to solving social issues, like helping regions with supermarket shortages."" Japan is covered by more than 50,000 convenience stores, but that figure fell for the first time in 2019. The traditional business model limits the locations where stores can be opened, and a new format is needed urgently. Shops also need to address increases in the minimum wage and the shrinking number of workers. Other retailers are rushing to improve the efficiency of their stores. Seven-Eleven Japan is teaming with tech services company NEC to experiment with automated shops that use facial recognition for payments. Lawson has introduced a ""smartphone cash register"" that lets customers read product barcodes with their own smartphones. Kinokuniya, a high-end supermarket, has opened a small grocery outside the gates of Mejiro Station on the busy Yamanote Line, using a system similar to that of FamilyMart. The U.S., China and other countries are leading the way in automated stores, but they have yet to embrace the model. ""Amazon Go"" stores once totaled 26, but as of September there were only 22. Some shops have adopted biometric authentication, letting customers pay simply by holding up their palms. But many consumers are uncomfortable with this idea, so companies are exploring ways to jointly use credit cards and app authentication."

The rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system A 29-year-old man sustained a light head wound after he fell while running to a bomb shelter. He was taken to Ashkelon’s Barzilai Medical Center for treatment, medics said. Footage of the rocket attack (above) was captured by a security camera in southern Israel, showing the moment of the launch just after 9 p.m. The attack triggered sirens in the town of Sderot and surrounding communities in southern Israel. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Meanwhile in the West Bank on Saturday evening, several hundred Palestinians clashed with Israel Defense Forces troops in a number of areas. IDF troops responded with riot control means. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that it treated eight people suffering from injuries from rubber bullets and another 15 cases of tear gas inhalation during clashes at Hawara checkpoint, south of Nablus. The Saturday night rocket fire came soon after Israel captured two more Islamic Jihad security prisoners who escaped from a high-security prison on Monday, after arresting two others the day before. Advertisement This also comes a day after Qatar’s envoy to Gaza said that efforts to send aid from his country to the Gaza Strip, including to employees of the Hamas government, had failed after the Palestinian Authority backed out of the deal. Shortly after 11 p.m. on Friday, Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip fired a single rocket towards Israel that was intercepted by the Iron Dome system, the army said. The rocket triggered warning sirens in the Eshkol region and local residents reported hearing several explosions. There were no reports of injuries or damage. In response to the rocket fire, the IDF carried out strikes on terror targets in the Gaza Strip in the early hours of Saturday morning, the military said. The IDF said that it struck a Hamas position used to carry out machine gun fire, and a storage site located near a school and mosques. There were no further details given on what the IDF believed was stored at the facility. The IDF also said that it hit a compound used to produce the concrete used to build the terror group’s underground tunnel network, which is said to be located near cultural sites. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Advertisement In the statement, the IDF reiterated that it holds Hamas responsible for all terror activities in the enclave. Qatar pledged $500 million for Gaza following the May 10-21 conflict that saw heavy bombardments in the Strip and intense rocket fire into Israel. The collapse of the deal was expected to further inflame tensions between Israel and Hamas, which has frequently stepped up provocations in a bid to pressure Israel to allow in money. The rocket was likely fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, coming just after Israel announced it had caught two Islamic Jihad fugitives who broke out of the Gilboa prison on Monday along with four other security prisoners. Qatari envoy Mohammed al-Emadi said that the deal was off because a mechanism agreed earlier in the week where Palestinian Authority banks would transfer the money to Hamas employees was no longer an option. He said that the banks had refused to take part, fearing they could be targeted by sanctions for transferring money to a terror group. The issue of the civil servants had been a sticking point in setting up a mechanism to transfer the money. On Monday, al-Emadi said that the issue had been resolved “following an agreement by the different parties.” The report came as Channel 12 news quotes sources close to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as saying that Israel sees a new round of violence with Hamas as a foregone conclusion — possibly within weeks — and was completing drawing up military plans. The report said that Israel wanted to deal with Hamas on its own terms and at a time of its choosing, and not be drawn into a conflict that would suit the terror group. Advertisement Qatari support is considered a crucial lifeline for impoverished Palestinians living in Gaza, which has been under Israeli blockade since 2007, the year the Hamas terror group took power. Israel, which still allows many goods into the Strip, views the blockade as a necessary measure to keep terror groups from being able to freely arm themselves and present a much greater threat. Before the latest Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas-led fighters in May, the flow of funds from Qatar was considered vital to maintaining relative calm between the Jewish state and the Islamists. But Israel has said that it was opposed to a resumption of the funding under the terms that existed before May’s hostilities, claiming that money was being used by armed groups rather than strictly for humanitarian needs.

(File) Industrialist Mukesh Ambani said today that his Reliance Industries (RIL) would ""establish and enable"" at least 100 GW of solar energy by 2030 -- over a fifth of the government's target of 450 GW of renewable energy capacity. Mr Ambani, addressing the International Climate Summit 2021, outlined a roadmap for New Energy business, calling it the ""next big value creation engine"" for Reliance and India. Reliance Industries, he said, is fully committed to realizing the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fuel India's green economy using clean energy. The efforts include the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga complex spread over 5,000 acres in Gujarat's Jamnagar, he said, which aims to be among the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. According to him, the complex would have four Giga factories covering the entire spectrum of renewable energy - an integrated photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory for the production of green hydrogen and a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. ""Over the next three years we will invest Rs 75,000 crore in these initiatives,"" Mr Ambani said, promising to create a fully integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem to India and Indians. He also said Reliance would ""aggressively pursue"" the target of making Green Hydrogen the most affordable fuel by bringing down its cost to initially under $2 per kg. RIL's Jamnagar complex is the world's biggest oil refinery, with the capacity to process 1.4 million barrels of petroleum a day. Bloomberg reports that in fiscal 2021, Reliance generated about 45 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions from its own operations, much of it from Jamnagar, which puts the company among the top such emitters in India. Mr Ambani said it was not enough to make economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions and the only option is rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy, he suggested. ""The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources. Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land,"" he said, asserting that this would bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India."

A French government decree issued on Thursday bumped the United States and Israel from the country's ""green"" list, down to ""orange,"" effectively prohibiting nonessential travel to France for unvaccinated visitors. Under France's rules, unvaccinated travelers from either country will still be allowed in provided they have an essential reason for travel, however they'll need a negative Covid-19 test before travel and must quarantine for seven days on arrival. France's move follow restrictions imposed on US travelers from several other European destinations. Earlier this week, Spain changed its entry policy for arrivals from the US, requiring them to have a certificate proving double vaccination. Covid-battered economies Denmark and the Netherlands have also recently updated their restrictions, requiring proof of vaccination for US travelers. Sweden, meanwhile, has banned all US arrivals regardless of vaccination status Italy last week began requiring all visitors, including those from the United States, to show proof of a PCR or antigen Covid test taken within 72 hours of travel, regardless of whether they are vaccinated. The new measures follow a nonbinding recommendation from the European Union to its member states earlier this month to begin restricting US arrivals following rising Covid-19 numbers across the United States during July and August.

6145,"pm7x14","France: Former health minister Agnes Buzyn charged with ""endangering the lives of others"" over her handling of the coronavirus pandemic","https://www.dw.com/en/france-former-health-minister-charged-over-covid-policies/a-59148855",235,"dw","France: Former health minister charged over COVID policies","2021-09-11 15:44:27-05","Former French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn has been put under formal investigation over her handling of the coronavirus pandemic, prosecutors said Friday. Buzyn, who was health minister from May 2017 to February 2020, had stepped down weeks after the first COVID cases were confirmed in France to run for mayor of Paris. She could face trial by the Court of Justice of the Republic, which was set up to investigate wrongdoing by ministers. Why is Agnes Buzyn being investigated? The 58-year-old has faced criticism over her initial statements about the pandemic. In January 2020, she said there was ""practically no risk"" of importing COVID-19 from Wuhan, China. A month later, she said the ""the tsunami has yet to come."" She has been charged with ""endangering the lives of others."" The spotlight on Buzyn's conduct is part of a wider probe into whether the French government was sufficiently prepared to face a pandemic and whether policy changes and U-turns, including on mask-wearing, were a sign of political failings. During a hearing on Friday morning, the former doctor said she would not ""let the action of the government be discredited, or my action as a minister, when we did so much to prepare our country for a global health crisis that is still ongoing."" Buzyn lost her bid for the Paris city hall and was appointed in January to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva, in charge of monitoring multilateral issues. She has already told a parliamentary probe that she alerted President Emmanuel Marcon and then-Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to the potential ""dangers"" of COVID-19 in January. A mandatory health pass for entry to restaurants and cultural sites has sparked mass protests across France for eight consecutive weeks How could this affect Emmanuel Macron's reelection chances? The investigation is a major blow for Macron, whose handling of the health crisis will face scrutiny during campaigning for the French presidential election next year. Macron's centrist party was decimated in regional elections this summer amid widespread criticism of lockdowns and the delayed COVID vaccination rollout. His government's decision to introduce a health pass has also brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets for more than eight consecutive weeks. The pass shows that people are fully vaccinated, have recently recovered from COVID-19, or received a recent negative test. Philippe and current Health Minister Olivier Veran are also being investigated and have seen their offices searched. What is the Court of Justice of the Republic? The Court of Justice was created in 1993 and allows the public to file complaints if they believe they are a victim of a crime carried out by a member of the government. Around 14,500 complaints have been received over the government's handling of the pandemic. Some critics accuse the court of being too slow, while others see the current probe as an example of the justice system's overreach. Some also believe French voters will get a chance to punish the government in next year's presidential election. Being put under formal investigation is just a first step. Judges will now decide whether there is sufficient proof of wrongdoing to go to court. mm/fb (AFP, Reuters)"

About 300 women - covered head-to-toe in accordance with strict new dress policies for education - waved white Taliban flags as speakers railed against the West and expressed support for the Islamists' policies. A handful wore blue burqas, which have only a small mesh window to see from, but most wore black niqabs covering most of the face apart from the eyes. Many also wore black gloves. Pictured: Afghan students listen to women speakers prior to their pro-Taliban rally outside the Shaheed Rabbani Education University in Kabul, Afghanistan, 11 September 2021 Women's rights in Afghanistan were sharply curtailed under the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, but since returning to power last month they have claimed they will implement a less extreme rule. This time, women will be allowed to attend university as long as classes are segregated by sex or at least divided by a curtain, the Taliban's education authority has said. They must also wear an abaya robe and niqab. The women, who organisers said were students, listened to a series of speeches at Shaheed Rabbani Education University in the capital, Kabul. Large Taliban flags flanked the podium, as the female speakers criticised women who have protested across Afghanistan in recent days. They also defended the new government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which has banned demonstrations unless permission is granted by the justice ministry. Daud Haqqani, director of foreign relations at the education ministry, said the protest was organised by the women, who had asked and been granted permission to demonstrate. About 300 women - covered head-to-toe in accordance with strict new dress policies for education - waved Taliban flags as speakers (pictured) railed against the West and expressed support for the Islamists' policies Taliban fighters stand guard outside a hall during a female student gathering before a pro-Taliban rally at the Shaheed Rabbani Education University in Kabul on September 11, 2021 'We are against those women who are protesting on the streets, claiming they are representative of women,' said the first speaker, covered head to toe. 'Is it freedom to like the last government? No, it is not freedom. The last government were misusing women. They were recruiting women just by their beauty,' she claimed. Some in the audience held babies, who occasionally cried during the speeches, while others were young girls clearly too young for university. A student named Shabana Omari told the crowd she agreed with the Taliban's policy that women should cover their heads. 'Those not wearing the hijab are harming all of us,' she said, referring to the headscarves worn by many Muslim women. 'The hijab is not an individual thing.'

Another speaker, Somaiya, said history had changed since the Taliban came back. 'After this we will not see 'bihijabi' (people not wearing headscarves),' she said. 'Women will be safe after this. We are supporting our government with all our strength.' After the speeches in the meeting hall, the women walked in organised lines a short distance on the street outside, holding printed banners and flanked by Taliban soldiers carrying rifles and machine guns. The public demonstration was in stark contrast with scenes in Kabul and elsewhere earlier in the week, when Taliban fighters fired into the air to disperse a number of protests against their rule, shooting two people dead. Pictured: Veiled women hold banners and placards while marching during a pro-Taliban rally outside the Shaheed Rabbani Education University in Kabul on September 11, 2021 'Women who left Afghanistan cannot represent us,' one pro-Taliban banner on Saturday read. 'We are satisfied with attitude and behaviour of Mujahideens (Taliban)' read another. The Taliban say they want to distance themselves from the harsher policies of old, when half the population was excluded from work and education. Under new rules, women may work 'in accordance with the principles of Islam', the Taliban have decreed, but few details have yet been given as to what that exactly might mean. Earlier this week, Taliban fighters beat female protesters and opened fire to disperse demonstrators in Kabul - just hours after the Islamists banned rallies. The militants announced a moratorium on demonstrations 'for the time being' on Wednesday night after the group was humiliated by viral images of women standing up to them. Footage posted online purported to show Taliban fighters beating female protesters in the streets - with one militant seen striking a woman with a crutch, hitting her on the arm before chasing her away. Footage posted online purported to show one militant seen striking a woman with a crutch, hitting her on the arm before chasing her away Taliban fighters were seen beating female protesters and opening fire to disperse them in Kabul hours after the Islamists banned rallies amid a wave of demonstrations Video also showed armed Islamists brandishing guns chasing women away from a busy road. It came amid reports women defied the Taliban ban on protests, gathering outside the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul until the militants opened fire to disperse the crowd. Footage showed Taliban in military fatigues preventing demonstrators from gathering and shouting at them to disperse. Gunshots and screams are then heard in the shaky footage, which MailOnline was unable to independently verify, before it hastily ends. Protest organisers had called off demonstrations after the ban was announced on Wednesday night amid a noticeably stronger armed Taliban presence - including special forces in military fatigues - on the streets of Kabul. The Islamists have taken a harsh stance to demonstrators - locking a crowd women in a basement to prevent them joining protests and whipping those who made to the rallies this week. Footage also showed the militants threatening demonstrators with weapons and firing warning shots into the air to forcibly disperse crowds. While harrowing images also emerged of journalists with angry welts and bruises after they were detained by Taliban fighters. The protests are proving an early test for the Taliban who have seen a show of resistance since taking power on August 15 that was unthinkable under the extremist group's last regime in the 1990s."

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dire warning that the world is moving in the wrong direction and faces ""a pivotal moment"" where continuing business as usual could lead to a breakdown of global order and a future of perpetual crisis. Changing course could signal a breakthrough to a greener and safer future, he said. The U.N. chief said the world's nations and people must reverse today's dangerous trends and choose ""the breakthrough scenario."" The world is under ""enormous stress"" on almost every front, he said, and the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call demonstrating the failure of nations to come together and take joint decisions to help all people in the face of a global life-threatening emergency. Guterres said this ""paralysis"" extends far beyond COVID-19 to the failures to tackle the climate crisis and ""our suicidal war on nature and the collapse of biodiversity,"" the ""unchecked inequality"" undermining the cohesion of societies, and technology's advances ""without guard rails to protect us from its unforeseen consequences."" In other signs of a more chaotic and insecure world, he pointed to rising poverty, hunger and gender inequality after decades of decline, the extreme risk to human life and the planet from nuclear war and a climate breakdown, and the inequality, discrimination and injustice bringing people into the streets to protest ""while conspiracy theories and lies fuel deep divisions within societies."" In a horizon-scanning report presented to the General Assembly and at a press conference Friday, Guterres said his vision for the ""breakthrough scenario"" to a greener and safer world is driven by ""the principle of working together, recognizing that we are bound to each other and that no community or country, however powerful, can solve its challenges alone."" The report -- ""Our Common Agenda"" -- is a response to last year's declaration by world leaders on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and the request from the assembly's 193 member nations for the U.N. chief to make recommendations to address the challenges for global governance. In today's world, Guterres said, ""Global decision-making is fixed on immediate gain, ignoring the long-term consequences of decisions -- or indecision."" He said multilateral institutions have proven to be ""too weak and fragmented for today's global challenges and risks."" What's needed, Guterres said, is not new multilateral bureaucracies but more effective multilateral institutions including a United Nations ""2.0"" more relevant to the 21st century. ""And we need multilateralism with teeth,"" he said. In the report outlining his vision ""to fix"" the world, Guterres said immediate action is needed to protect the planet's ""most precious"" assets from oceans to outer space, to ensure it is livable, and to deliver on the aspirations of people everywhere for peace and good health. He called for an immediate global vaccination plan implemented by an emergency task force, saying ""investing $50 billion in vaccinations now could add an estimated $9 trillion to the global economy in the next four years."" The report proposes that a global Summit of the Future take place in 2023 that would not only look at all these issues but go beyond traditional security threats ""to strengthen global governance of digital technology and outer space, and to manage future risks and crises,"" he said. It would also consider a New Agenda for Peace including measures to reduce strategic risks from nuclear weapons, cyber warfare and lethal autonomous weapons, which Guterres called one of humanity's most destabilizing inventions. The secretary-general said a new United Nations Futures Lab will publish regular reports ""on megatrends and risks."" He said the COVID-19 pandemic also exposed deficiencies in the global financial system. To tackle these weaknesses and integrate the global financial system with other global priorities, Guterres proposed holding summits every two years of the 20 leading economies in the G20, the U.N.'s Economic and Social Council, the heads of international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and the U.N. secretary-general. He also called for the correction of ""a major blind spot in how we measure progress and prosperity,"" saying Gross Domestic Product or GDP fails to account for ""the incalculable social and environmental damage that may be caused by the pursuit of profit."" ""My report calls for new metrics that value the life and well-being of the many over short-term profit for the few,"" Guterres said. It also calls for a new Emergency Platform that would be triggered automatically in large-scale crises comprising governments, the U.N. system, international financial institutions, civil society, the private sector and others, he said. Guterres also proposed ""repurposing"" the U.N. Trusteeship Council, whose work is largely completed, ""to create an intergovernmental body for intergenerational issues"" that would be a platform to consider the interests of the entire human family, present and future. As part of a new focus on the world's young people and future generations, Guterres said he intends to appoint a special envoy for future generations to ensure the interests of those born in the 21st century and establish a new United Nations Youth Office. Saying much of the world's unease is rooted in poverty and growing inequality, Guterres noted that the 10 richest men saw their combined wealth increase by half a trillion dollars since the COVID-19 pandemic began while 55% of the world's population, or 4 billion people, ""are one step away from destitution, with no social protection whatsoever."" To address the threats to social stability, the U.N. chief recommended a series of measures ""to provide universal health coverage, education, housing, decent work and income protection for everyone, everywhere."" Guterres proposed holding a World Social Summit in 2025 on global efforts to address these issues and repair the social fabric. The secretary-general also proposed global action to tackle disinformation and conspiracy theories and promote facts, science and ""integrity"" in public discourse. ""We must make lying wrong again,"" Guterres said."

The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.

The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment. Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East. “The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement. McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.” Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.” “The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in its statement."

(Planet Labs Inc. via AP) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. has removed its most advanced missile defense system and Patriot batteries from Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, even as the kingdom faced continued air attacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show. The redeployment of the defenses from Prince Sultan Air Base outside of Riyadh came as America’s Gulf Arab allies nervously watched the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan , including their last-minute evacuations from Kabul’s besieged international airport. While tens of thousands of American forces remain across the Arabian Peninsula as a counterweight to Iran, Gulf Arab nations worry about the U.S.’s future plans as its military perceives a growing threat in Asia that requires those missile defenses. Tensions remain high as negotiations appear stalled in Vienna over Iran’s collapsed nuclear deal with world powers, raising the danger of future confrontations in the region. ADVERTISEMENT “Perceptions matter whether or not they’re rooted in a cold, cold reality. And the perception is very clear that the U.S. is not as committed to the Gulf as it used to be in the views of many people in decision-making authority in the region,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. “From the Saudi point of view, they now see Obama, Trump and Biden — three successive presidents — taking decisions that signify to some extent an abandonment.” Prince Sultan Air Base, some 115 kilometers (70 miles) southeast of Riyadh, has hosted several thousand U.S. troops since a 2019 missile-and-drone attack on the heart of the kingdom’s oil production. That attack, though claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, appears instead to have been carried out by Iran , according to experts and physical debris left behind. Tehran has denied launching the attack, though a drill in January saw Iranian paramilitary forces use similar drones . Just southwest of the air base’s runway, a 1-square-kilometer (third-of-a-square-mile) area set off by an earthen berm saw American forces station Patriot missile batteries, as well as one advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit, according to satellite images from Planet Labs Inc. A THAAD can destroy ballistic missiles at a higher altitude than Patriots. ADVERTISEMENT A satellite image seen by the AP in late August showed some of the batteries removed from the area, though activity and vehicles still could be seen there. A high-resolution Planet Lab satellite picture taken Friday showed the batteries’ pads at the site empty, with no visible activity. A redeployment of the missiles had been rumored for months, in part due to a desire to face what American officials see as the looming “great powers conflict” with China and Russia. However, the withdrawal came just as a Houthi drone attack on Saudi Arabia wounded eight people and damaged a commercial jetliner at the kingdom’s airport in Abha. The kingdom has been locked in a stalemate war with the Houthis since March 2015. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby acknowledged “the redeployment of certain air defense assets” after receiving questions from the AP. He said the U.S. maintained a “broad and deep” commitment to its Mideast allies. “The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby said. In a statement to the AP, the Saudi Defense Ministry described the kingdom’s relationship with the U.S. as “strong, longstanding and historic” even while acknowledging the withdrawal of the American missile defense systems. It said the Saudi military “is capable of defending its lands, seas and airspace, and protecting its people.” “The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the statement said. Despite those assurances, Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, the kingdom’s former intelligence chief whose public remarks often track with the thoughts of its Al Saud ruling family, has linked the Patriot missile deployments directly to America’s relationship to Riyadh. “I think we need to be reassured about American commitment,” the prince told CNBC in an interview aired this week . “That looks like, for example, not withdrawing Patriot missiles from Saudi Arabia at a time when Saudi Arabia is the victim of missile attacks and drone attacks — not just from Yemen, but from Iran.” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on a tour of the Mideast in recent days, had been slated to go to Saudi Arabia but the trip was canceled due to what American officials referred to as scheduling problems. Saudi Arabia declined to discuss why Austin’s trip didn’t happen after the withdrawal of the missile defenses. Saudi Arabia maintains its own Patriot missile batteries and typically fires two missiles at an incoming target. That’s become an expensive proposition amid the Houthi campaign, as each Patriot missile costs more than $3 million. The kingdom also claims to intercept nearly every missile and drone launched at the kingdom, an incredibly high success rate previously questioned by experts . While Greece agreed in April to lend a Patriot missile battery to Saudi Arabia, the timing of the U.S. withdrawals comes amid wider uncertainty over the American posture in the region. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries have renewed diplomacy with Iran as a hedge. “I think we saw in Biden’s statements on Afghanistan, the way he said things that he’s clearly going to put U.S. interests first and obviously that came as quite a disappointment to partners and allies around the world who maybe hoped for something different after Trump,” said Ulrichsen, the research fellow. “He sounds quite similar to an ‘America First’ approach, just sort of a different tone.” ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Lawyers for Roberts told The Sun on Friday that they had served the prince with papers for their sex assault lawsuit. 5 Prince Andrew's team reportedly plans to attempt to have the case tossed Credit: AP 5 The prince has denied Virginia Roberts' allegations Credit: Rex Features The Duke of York, 61, was served at his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor last month, according to a document filed on Friday. Roberts, 38, who is one of the most well-known Jeffrey Epstein victims, is accusing the prince of abusing her three times when she was under the age of 18. Andrew, however, has strongly denied the claims in the past and has said he doesn't recall meeting Roberts - who also goes by her married name Giuffre. His lawyers claim the court papers were not properly served and plan to boycott a Monday court hearing, it was reported. Andrew's team also plans to attempt to get the case thrown out on a technicality related to a confidential settlement Roberts signed in 2009. She reportedly reached a settlement with Epstein in Florida that could contain clauses that would prevent her from taking actions against individuals she's accusing of being the late financier's co-conspirators. One of those people is Alan Dershowitz, who previously represented Epstein and was accused of sexual assault by Roberts in 2019. She reportedly dropped the claim because of the Epstein settlement last month. Dershowitz has lodged a request with the Manhattan court dealing with the case against Prince Andrew to have Roberts' settlement unsealed because he believes it'll help get the case against him tossed. ""We strongly suspect that Virginia and her lawyers may have committed fraud on the court by filing a lawsuit against Prince Andrew after dismissing the battery case against me,"" Dershowitz said. ""The same reasons for dismissing the case against me seem to apply to Prince Andrew. ""These documents should get the charges against Prince Andrew thrown out. It's an airtight defense for Prince Andrew and a potential fraud on the court."" Roberts' lawyer, David Boies, said he could not comment on the specifics of her settlement, but added that there is ""no evidence that Prince Andrew was intended to be covered by the release."" Virginia’s team say an official process server, Cesar Augusto Sepulveda, delivered the papers at the Lodge — one of five attempts they made over the past month. Mr Sepulveda is a private investigator and self-described “super- recogniser” who typically works for London law firms. The document filed yesterday says he was denied entry to the Lodge on August 26 and told that staff had been “primed” not to accept any papers. HEARING SET FOR MONDAY When he returned the next day, police at the main gate allowed him to leave the summons. Virginia’s lead lawyer David Boies, 80, said: “A policeman took the court papers and said he would give them to him (Andrew). We certainly didn’t expect that!” The legal team also emailed a copy to Andrew’s lawyers via Barbara Fontaine, Senior Master of the Queen’s Bench Division — a post appointed by Andrew’s mum. Mr Boies said: “They responded saying they had got it.” A third method saw the papers emailed to the Duke of York’s office. Lawyers were told: “This is an automatic acknowledgment to tell you we have received your email safely.” A copy was posted to the Royal Lodge, by Royal Mail. Finally, the lawsuit was emailed to Andrew’s UK lawyers, and US attorney Blair Berk who represented film producer Harvey Weinstein in his sex assault trial. Mr Boies says at least two methods of alternative service they have used qualify under US law. Roberts' explosive lawsuit was filed in New York on August 9. The first hearing in the case is set for Monday before district judge Lewis Kaplan. He will also decide whether Andrew has been officially served. Boies told The Sun he will ask the judge to set a date by which Andrew has to reply. He added: “We will make a report to the court of what we have done. “If the court confirms Andrew has been served, the judge will give him a deadline to respond. “I don’t believe his legal team are going to ignore this but that’s what they have done consistently, so maybe that will happen. If Andrew doesn’t respond there can be a default judgment against him.” 'REGRETTABLE' METHODS Boies faces a conference call with Judge Kaplan in New York at 4pm EST on Monday. Andrew is currently at Balmoral with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. His lawyers have objected to the “regrettable” methods used by Roberts’ team to serve him, and suggested they were not legally binding. Gary Bloxsome, from Blackfords LLP who are believed to be representing the Duke, made the claims in a letter to Barbara Fontaine, obtained by ABC News. He said: “[Virginia Roberts' lawyers] have made several public, well-publicised, attempts at irregular service of these proceedings in this jurisdiction, in at least one case accompanied by a media representative. “These have included attempted personal service of our client at his home, the instruction of a private process server, and attempts to email the proceedings not only to this firm, but to barristers (who are not authorised to conduct litigation) known to have acted for the duke.” Bloxsome maintains that under British law, a valid request for assistance from UK court officials must come from a judicial or diplomatic officer in the US. If the judge overseeing the case made a request, Mr Bloxsome said “it is likely that our client will be content to agree to a convenient method of alternative service”. He added: “However, absent being satisfied of some very good reason to do so, our client is highly unlikely to be prepared to agree to any form of alternative service while the approach to service of these proceedings remains irregular and the viability of the claim remains open to doubt.” 5 The Duke of York has denied any wrongdoing 5 Roberts accused Prince Andrew of abusing her three times while she was underage Credit: BBC supplied by Pixel8000 07917221968 5 The prince's lawyers are reportedly trying to get the case thrown out"

Zemari Ahmadi, 43, was driving the 1996 Toyota Corolla that was destroyed in the August 29 drone strike, killing him and nine family members, including seven children, according to a New York Times investigation. The Pentagon still maintains that only three civilians died, despite the family now detailing in the new report how their 10 relatives were killed in the blast. Days after the attack, President Joe Biden gave a speech in which he marked the withdrawal of American troops in Afghanistan by the August 31 deadline. He touted America's ability to strike terrorists and targets without boots on the ground. But he failed to mention the high civilian casualty rate from the August 29 drone strike, and he failed to mention that children had been killed. 'We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our service members and dozen of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K, we are not done with you yet,' he said in his speech. Emal Ahmadi, another relative of the strike's victims, told the BBC that his two-year-old daughter who was killed in the strike while the family were waiting for a phone call from US personnel instructing them to go to the airport for evacuation 12-year-old Farzad Ahmadi was among the oldest of the children killed according to Ramin Yousufi, a member of the family who vilified the US strike as a 'brutal attack which happened based on wrong information' Faisal Ahmadi, 16, was among the seven children who witnesses say were killed in the strike Ahmadi worked for US-based aid group Nutrition and Education International, and spent the day running routine errands for the group, loading nothing into the car other than jugs full of water to bring home to his family, the Times reported, citing witnesses and surveillance video footage. 'All of them were innocent,' Ahmadi's brother Emal told the newspaper, noting that Ahmadi had sought refugee status with the US based on his international aid work. 'You say he was ISIS, but he worked for the Americans.' The Pentagon has insisted that Ahmadi's movements linked him to an ISIS-K safehouse, and that there were explosives in his vehicle intended to be used in a suicide attack on US troops in the final hours of the Kabul evacuation. 'This was a righteous strike,' said Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark A. Milley last week, claiming that Ahmadi was an 'ISIS facilitator'. In a statement to DailyMail.com on Friday, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby stood by the intelligence assessment that led to the strike, but did not deny there were civilian casualties. 'U.S. Central Command continues to assess the results of the airstrike in Kabul on August 29. We won't get ahead of that assessment,' said Kirby. 'However, as we have said, no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties,' he added. 'Additionally, as Chairman Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport,' the spokesman said. The drone strike occurred at the home where Ahmadi lived with three of his brothers and their families. 'This was a righteous strike,' said Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark A. Milley last week, claiming that Ahmadi was an 'ISIS facilitator' A damaged vehicle is at the site of the U.S. airstrike in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan The drone strike occurred at the home where Ahmadi lived with three of his brothers and their families Expert analysis of photos of the scene show no evidence of a second blast, as the Pentagon claims The broken gate of the house is seen after U.S. drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan. The US claimed the drone strike destroyed a vehicle carrying 'multiple suicide bombers' According to the Times, killed in the drone strike were Ahmadi and three of his children, Zamir, 20, Faisal, 16, and Farzad, 10; Ahmadi's cousin Naser, 30; three of Ahmadi's nephews, Arwin, seven, Benyamin, six, and Hayat, two; and two three-year-old girls, Malika and Somaya. The drone strike in Kabul came as US forces were on high alert following an ISIS-K suicide blast on August 26 that killed 13 US troops and scores of Afghans on August 26. A separate US drone strike in remote Nangarhar Province on August 27 killed two alleged ISIS-K planners and facilitators, according to the Pentagon, though their identities have not yet been publicly confirmed. On the morning of August 29, Ahmadi left his family home a few kilometers west of the Kabul airport at around 9am. It was around this time that US officials tell the Times that his car came under surveillance. An MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked Ahmadi's Corolla as he went about his day, picking up two passengers and the laptop from the home of N.E.I.'s country director on his way to work. The Pentagon claims that the vehicle was tracked after leaving a known ISIS-K safehouse, but it is unclear whether this refers to Ahmadi's home or one of his stops on the way to work. However, an improvised rocket attack on the Kabul airport was launched from a car near the home of the non-profit director the morning after the drone strike. The Times visited the director, who said he had nothing to do with ISIS and had his own refugee resettlement case pending in the US. Emal Hamedi, a survivor of the U.S. drone strike, is seen at the site of the attack in Kabul Ramal Ahmadi, second from left, weeps uncontrollably at the mass funeral attended by dozens of friends and family Ahmadi arrived at the N.E.I offices at around 9.35am, security camera footage shows. Witnesses say he and his co-workers went to a Taliban-controlled police station that morning to request permission to distribute food to displaced refugees living in a nearby park. They returned to the offices at around 2pm, and surveillance footage shows that Ahmadi began filling up water jugs with a hose, which his family say he brought home from the office after water service was cut off in their neighborhood. 'I filled the containers myself, and helped him load them into the trunk,' a guard at the office told the Times. Meanwhile, US officials say that their surveillance drone tracked Ahmadi to a compound eight to 12 kilometers southwest of the airport, where he was observed loading heavy packages into the car. The location matched the offices of N.E.I., a California-based non-profit that promotes the cultivation of soy crops in Afghanistan. Witnesses say Ahmadi loaded nothing into his car other than the water jugs in the trunk and two laptops in the passenger compartment. Leaving work, gave his two co-workers rides home. They told the Times that it was a normal commute, except that Ahmadi did not turn on his car radio to listen to pop music as normal, for fear of running afoul of the Taliban. Ramal Ahmadi, centre, is supported by family members at the mass funeral of the 10 victims killed in the drone strike When Ahmadi arrived home, his children, nieces and nephews ran out of the house to greet him, some of them piling into the car as he backed it in to the gated courtyard, according to witnesses. US officials say that operator of the Reaper drone quickly scanned and saw only a single adult male greeting the vehicle, and therefore assessed with 'reasonable certainty' that no women, children or noncombatants would be killed. A Hellfire missile struck the Corolla before its engine shut off. Ahmadi's brother Romal was sitting on the ground floor with his wife when a sudden blast blew out the windows. They ran outside to discover a scene of devastation and death. Six of those who died were inside the car, the others were in the garden of the home in the tightly-packed Khajeh Baghra neighbourhood. Samia Ahmadi told the New York Times she was in a room next to the courtyard when she was struck by the impact of the blast and, at first, 'thought it was the Taliban'. She staggered outside where she was greeted by the dismembered bodies of her family members. 'I saw the whole scene,' she said, weeping over the death of her cousin and fiancé Naser. 'America used us to defend itself, and now they've destroyed Afghanistan,' she said. 'Whoever dropped this bomb on our family, may God punish you.' Pentagon officials, including General Milley, insist that there was a second blast after the missile strike, proving the vehicle carried explosives. But expert analysis of photos of the scene show no evidence of a second blast. There were no collapsed walls, and the security gate had a single dent, suggesting one shock wave. 'It seriously questions the credibility of the intelligence or technology utilized to determine this was a legitimate target,' Chris Cobb-Smith, a British Army veteran and security consultant, told the Times."

The school remained closed on Thursday due to the commotion, and pupils were also allowed to stay home on Friday. Some officers who carried out the checks were placed on forced leave, and at least one teacher was suspended. Aftercare has now been provided to teachers, pupils, and parents. Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Gilmar 'Pik' Pisas, spoke to teachers at the school on Thursday and announced that an investigation was launched into what went wrong. According to him, it is clear that the check went too far. He understands that students and parents are shocked by this. In Curacao, there are often checks for drugs or weapons in pupils' possession at schools. However, having pupils undress is not common and according to some lawyers is only allowed if there are serious suspicions of possession of drugs or weapons. That was not the case this past Tuesday.

Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said an operation involving its personnel as well as the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Border Force arrested the British man from Stockton-on-Tees and five Nicaraguans aboard a Jamaican-flagged yacht 80 miles out to sea. The luxury yacht Kahu, which was sailing from the Caribbean, was escorted back to an undisclosed location on the UK mainland where a team carried out a deep rummage search and discovered the enormous haul of class A drugs. The men, whose ages range from 24 to 49, were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and remain in custody awaiting interviews, the NCA said. The NCA deputy director, Matt Horne, said: “There’s no doubt these drugs would have been sold on into communities across the UK in such ways as county lines fuelling more crime and misery. “Organised crime groups (OCG) are motivated by money. The deprivation of these drugs will smash a hole in the OCG’s plans and ability to operate. “Also, the arrests of the men transporting the drugs means the crime group has lost trusted offenders who would have been key to their operation. “We continue to work with partners at home such as Border Force and those abroad such as the AFP to protect the public from the class A drugs threat.” The AFP assistant commissioner, Lesa Gale, said: “Intelligence from Operation Ironside had enabled the AFP to assist international enforcement partners in disrupting an alleged sophisticated criminal network. “Operation Ironside has opened the door to unprecedented collaboration across law enforcement agencies around the globe. “This result highlights the importance of the AFP’s partnership with the NCA to combat offshore transnational organised crime that impacts both of our countries. “The AFP and NCA have a strong, historic relationship and both agencies recognise the significant threat to national security posed by transnational organised crime.”"

REUTERS/Mariana Bazo LIMA, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Abimael Guzman, leader of the Shining Path rebels who nearly toppled the Peruvian state in a bloody Maoist revolution, died on Saturday while in prison and following several weeks of poor health, the government said. He was 86. Guzman was captured in 1992 in Lima and jailed for the rest of his life after being convicted as a terrorist. He died one day before the anniversary of his capture, when he was paraded in front of the press in a striped white and black uniform that is not normally used in Peru. Susana Silva, head of Peru's prison system, told RPP radio on Saturday that Guzman had been ill in recent months and had been released from a hospital in early August. She said his health condition worsened in the past two days, without elaborating further, adding Guzman was set to receive more medical attention on Saturday but died in his cell around 6:40 a.m. local time (1140 GMT). Defense minister Walter Ayala said Guzman had died of a ""generalized infection."" ""The terrorist leader Abimael Guzman has died, responsible for the loss of an uncountable number of lives"" tweeted President Pedro Castillo. ""Our position condemning terrorism is firm and unwavering. Only in democracy will we build a just Peru."" A former philosophy professor, Guzman was a lifelong communist who traveled to China in the late 1960s and was awed by Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. He resolved to bring Mao's brand of communism to Peru through a class war that he launched in 1980 on the day that Peru held its first democratic elections following over a decade of military dictatorship. Guzman founded the Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, transforming it from a ragtag band of peasants and radical students into Latin America's most stubborn guerrilla force. An estimated 69,000 people, mostly in Peru's poor interior, were killed between 1980 and 2000 in the internal conflict launched by the Shining Path, mostly in indigenous Andean communities. Shining Path's bold and immaculately planned attacks, its networks of informants and spies, and Guzman's uncanny ability to evade arrest gave him an almost legendary reputation for seeming to be in all places at once. During years of fighting, he had been rumored to be dead, gravely ill, or living a comfortable life in Europe. In 1980, after years of preparation, Guzman, a former university professor, led a band of supporters into the Andes Mountains outside the town of Ayacucho. Armed with shotguns, dynamite and machetes, they began attacking security forces, elected officials and peasants who resisted their indoctrination with a fervor and ruthlessness never seen in a Latin American rebel group. Fanning out from the Southern city of Ayacucho, the Shining Path attracted thousands more militants from poor peasant communities and universities. People in the capital city of Lima got their first taste of the Shining Path in 1981 when guerrillas hung dozens of dead dogs from lampposts - ""the dogs of capitalism,"" said signs pinned to the animals. By the late 1980s, the group had become such a threat to the state that two-thirds of Peruvians lived in areas under emergency rule - essentially, martial law. His followers called Guzman the Fourth Sword of Marxism, after Marx, Lenin and Mao, and idolized him in revolutionary chants, songs, posters and literature. His few written works, though little esteemed by Marxist academics, became like mantras for Shining Path followers who repeated his sayings as if they were biblical truths. Shining Path propaganda posters showed the bespectacled Guzman towering over peasant masses and guerrilla armies, pointing with one hand and holding Mao's revolutionary ""Little Red Book"" in the other. But the first image most Peruvians saw of Guzman was anything but revolutionary. Apparently drunk, he danced to the main tune of the film Zorba the Greek and posed for snapshots with supporters in a Shining Path video captured by police in 1990 and shown on television. The video made it clear he was alive and still in charge, but it punctured his reputation for austerity and demoralized Shining Path militants. Nevertheless, their attacks intensified, leading then-President Alberto Fujimori to seize near-dictatorial powers, in what he said was an attempt to crush the revolt. After Guzman was captured by police at a spacious safe house in a middle-class neighborhood of Lima in 1992, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Shining Path largely collapsed as a military threat, although remnants remain to this day. Authorities say that rebels claiming to belong to a dissident faction of the Shining Path killed 16 people in a remote jungle area just this year. In 2018, Guzman was given a second life sentence for a 1992 Lima car bomb attack that killed 25 people. Guzman's first wife, Augusta La Torre, died in mysterious circumstances in the late 1980s. In 2010, he married his longtime girlfriend, Elena Iparraguirre, who, like Guzman, is serving a life sentence. Both women were Shining Path leaders.

The protest coincides with Catalonia's national day, or ""Diada"", which commemorates the 1714 fall of Barcelona in the War of the Spanish Succession and the region's subsequent loss of institutions. As in other years, the march will get underway at 17:14 (1514 GMT) -- a nod to the year 1714. The slogan this year is: ""We will fight for independence and win"". At its peak in 2014, the annual demonstration brought an estimated 1.8 million people onto the streets. While Catalonia was the epicentre in July of a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections, the situation has since improved and a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people was recently lifted. Jordi Cuixart, the leader of grassroots separatist movement Omnium Cultural, said he hoped to ""bring hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets"" this year to ""prove once again that our movement is more alive than ever"". But much has changed since the frenetic autumn of 2017 when Catalonia's bid to break away from Spain triggered the country's worst political crisis in decades. Leaders of the wealthy northeastern region, which has a population of 7.8 million, defied a government ban to organise a secession referendum and then issued a short-lived declaration of independence. Those behind the move were arrested, tried and sentenced to long jail terms by Spain's top court, while others fled abroad to avoid prosecution, leaving the movement sharply at odds over how to move forward. The Spanish government's pardon in June of nine Catalan separatist leaders, including Cuixart, has also removed a rallying cry for the pro-independence camp. Only 600,000 people turned out for the Diada in 2019. Last year, coronavirus-related health restrictions reduced the celebrations to separate events which drew fewer than 60,000 people. This year's protest comes as top-level talks on resolving the Catalan crisis are set to resume next week between Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's minority government and the separatist regional government of Catalonia. The separatists have two key demands -- an amnesty for those involved in the failed independence bid, which would exonerate those who fled abroad, and a referendum on self-determination, this time with Spain's approval. But Madrid is implacably opposed to both. Tensions rose sharply this week after Spain's central government suspended plans to expand Barcelona airport, citing a ""lack of confidence"" in Catalonia's regional leadership. Catalonia's regional leader Pere Aragones denounced the suspension as ""blackmail"". © 2021 AFP"

The monarchy traces its history back at least to William the Conqueror, who invaded England in 1066, but also claims ties to the patchwork of kingdoms and principalities which stretched across what became England, Scotland and Wales long before that date. Mantel, best known for her Wolf Hall trilogy that traced the rise of blacksmith's son Thomas Cromwell to Henry VIII's chief minister and then his downfall and execution, said she admired the devotion of Queen Elizabeth, 95, and heir Charles, Prince of Wales. ""I think they do it as well as anyone possibly could, take it as seriously as anyone could,"" Mantel, 69, told The Times. But when asked how long the monarchy had left, Mantel told The Times that her ""back of the envelope"" calculation was just two generations. ""It’s very hard to understand the thinking behind the monarchy in the modern world when people are just seen as celebrities,"" she said. If her view turns out to be correct, Elizabeth's great-grandson, Prince George, 8, who is third in line to the throne after his grandfather Charles, 72, and father Prince William, 39, would not become king. Mantel triggered anger in Britain earlier this month by telling La Repubblica that England was now a washed-out place that ran on ""the memory of power"". She described Brexiteers as callow and often ridiculous opportunists. ""I'd like people to stop shouting and start listening to each other,"" she said of Britain. ""I think in this country at this time it would be a change that could save us."" Although surveys suggest a clear majority of Britons continue to support the monarchy and especially respect and admire the queen, an opinion poll in May showed that young people in Britain would now prefer an elected head of state.

REUTERS/Albert Gea BARCELONA, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Thousands of Catalans chanted, sang and waved flags as they marched through Barcelona on Saturday, calling for the region's independence from Spain. The march, organised by the grassroots Assemblea Nacional Catalana ANC, was the first since Spain's government pardoned nine Catalan separatist leaders who had been jailed for their role in a 2017 botched bid for independence, which was Spain's biggest political crisis in decades. Most marchers wore face coverings. Police said about 108,000 people took part. ANC put the figure close to 400,000. The figure was lower than in 2019, when about 600,000 marched, and last year, when only small static protests were organised to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Some of the nine pardoned politicians and activists attended Saturday's protests. In Catalonia, Sept. 11 marks La Diada, the anniversary of the fall of Barcelona to Spanish forces in 1714 and it has been marked in the past decade by separatist rallies. ""For the first time in four years, nine very special people have participated in La Diada again. The political prisoners are back on the streets,"" said ANC chairwoman Elisenda Paluzie. Cultural activist Jordi Cuixart, who was among those jailed, urged the crowd to continue to fight for independence. ""Those who ask us to turn the page and do not want us to fight for self-determination... What is Spain's plan for Catalonia? None. Only repression and more repression,"" he said. The protests took place at a moment of lower tension between Barcelona and Madrid than in past years as the central and regional governments favour dialogue despite their opposing views on independence. The central and regional governments are expected to meet next week in Barcelona to resume talks on Catalonia's political conflict, which have been suspended since Feb. 2020. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has not confirmed yet whether he will attend, and the talks risk being overshadowed by a recent clash between both governments related to Barcelona's airport. The Spanish government has said it is cancelling a proposed 1.7-billion-euro ($2-billion) investment to expand the airport, saying it lacked backing from regional authorities who have questioned its potential environmental impact while accusing Madrid of acting dishonestly.

Photo: Mitchell Luo via Unsplash. Alongside other tech and social media giants last year, the firm announced that it would stop responding to any request for user information coming from the city’s authorities, unless they were made via the US Justice Department. The latest disclosure indicates a reversal in the company’s position last year. Google “produced some data” in response to three out of 43 requests it received from the Hong Kong authorities for user information during the second half of last year, the firm said in response to HKFP’s enquiry sent in May. One of the requests it complied with was an emergency disclosure request involving a credible threat to life, the company said. Facebook, meanwhile, denied an emergency request last year. The remaining two Google complied with involved human trafficking – it said the two requests were unrelated to national security and were supported by search warrants signed by a magistrate as part of an investigation. They were processed according to the company’s global policy on government requests for user information, Google added. None of the responses included users’ content data, the company said. Google’s general policy on responding to government requests states that it may provide other metadata, such as subscriber information including name, associated email and phone numbers, IP addresses, billing information, timestamps and email headers. Google provided user data to 7 per cent of requests it received from the Hong Kong authorities between July and December, 2020. Photo: Screenshot from Google’s Transparency Report. The revelation means Google resumed its compliance with at least some user data requests from the local government. Last year, it said it would not respond to any of them unless they were made through the bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the US Justice Department, where the company is headquartered. Google said the three Hong Kong requests they complied with were not made under the treaty. Emergency requests involving threats to life are not required to go through the treaty, according to its global policy, they added. Requests received In total, the 42 legal requests it received during the six-month reporting period involved 46 user accounts, whilst the one emergency disclosure request involved a single account. The tech giant said it still requires the vast majority of Hong Kong government requests to be processed through diplomatic procedures, including any national security law related requests. File photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP. Google’s policy states that the company responds to data requests in accordance with the laws of the requesting country and international norms. It also pushes to narrow down the scope of such requests and may inform the account holder of the request by email unless legally prohibited from doing so, its policy reads. Google did not respond to HKFP’s questions over whether they notified the Hong Kong users in the three requests. The search giant, along with Twitter, said within a week of the national security law’s enactment last June that they had paused all data and information requests from the Hong Kong authorities, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. A month later, it said it would stop responding directly to user data requests from the city’s authorities, according to a Washington Post report. The company also notified the Hong Kong police that its requests would need to be directed via the US Justice Department to be processed under the MLAT – “a cumbersome process” that could take up to months, the newspaper reported. Similar to Google, other US tech firms – Apple, Facebook and Microsoft – all said at the time that they had paused handling requests for user data emanating from the Hong Kong government as they reviewed the new law. In the year preceding the law, the companies provided user data in response to hundreds of Hong Kong government requests, HKFP reported in May. Hong Kong police emblem. Photo: Candice Chau/HKFP. Facebook’s transparency report published this June stated that it rejected all 202 requests from the Hong Kong authorities for user information in the latter half of 2020, including an emergency request. Meanwhile, Twitter also did not respond to one request from the Hong Kong government during this time. Apple and Microsoft have not published their transparency reports for this period. According to an earlier report covering the six months before the law was enacted, Apple provided non-content information in response to 19 to 50 per cent of Hong Kong government’s requests for user data. Microsoft also provided non-content data in response to about 60 per cent of law enforcement requests from Hong Kong during the same period. Alternatives for data privacy Online privacy and security expert Eric Fan said Google’s latest revelations were “surprising,” as they appear to have contradicted their own public statement last year, and without explanation as to why it decided not to adhere to it. “Many people have higher [standards] for personal privacy in the wake of the national security law and social movement,” he told HKFP, referring to the 2019 protest and unrest. Globally, he said there was calls for people to “DeGoogle” and boycott the services out of privacy concerns: “Some may choose to use Protonmail or search engine DuckDuckGo instead of Google. “There are alternatives for those who care about personal privacy, they do not have to only use one [company’s products],” Fan said. But Fan said he could not speculate as to why Google responded to some requests, while other companies did not. Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

Under proposed legislative amendments, the city’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data may request information from anyone to assist investigations into doxxing activities, which the authorities plan to criminalise. Under the proposed law, authorities could be empowered to search and arrest suspects without a warrant, if they do not comply with requests. Hong Kong staff of service providers based overseas may also be at risk. An industry group – with members including Google, Twitter and Facebook – issued a letter to the Hong Kong government on behalf of its members in July, saying tech companies may have no choice but to refrain from investing, or offering its services in the city, if the government moves forward with what it called a “completely disproportionate and unnecessary response” to doxxing. Doxxing involves the malicious publishing of private or identifying data. HKFP was among several media outlets that received a Google grant in 2019 to help create a media funding solution."

ADVERTISEMENT Dr Hans Kluge said new strains of Covid will continue to emerge and the virus will remain with us like the flu. Earlier this year, he said the pandemic would be over once 70 per cent of people were fully immunised. But he admitted today that the situation had now changed, so leaders need to adapt their vaccination strategy. Up to 80 per cent of people in wealthy countries are double-jabbed, but less than 0.1 per cent have received a vaccine in poorer countries. Some experts initially thought that once enough people were vaccinated, the virus would be unable to spread. But while the jabs are highly effective at preventing hospitalisations and deaths, they are less effective at stopping transmission, leading officials to warn that the world must learn to live with the virus. In wealthier countries, including Portugal, Singapore and Denmark,more than 70 per cent of the entire population has been double-jabbed. But in poorer countries, such as Tanzania, Haiti and Chad as little as 0.1 per cent have received both doses, according to Our World in Data Scientists from Imperial College London estimate that the three Covid jabs dished out in the UK reduce transmission by 40 per cent, while Warwick University calculated the figure to be 45 per cent. This means of 100 unvaccinated people who would pass on the virus, just 60 to 55 of them would pass it on if they were double-jabbed Click here to resize this module Britain is 'not an outlier' in launching its own Covid vaccine booster drive, minister says Britain isn't on its own in wanting to launch a booster Covid vaccine drive, a Government ministers claimed today after one of the key figures in the development of the AstraZeneca jab urged No10 to send spare doses abroad. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden insisted Britain would not be an 'outlier' in terms of dishing out third doses and he expects the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to issue the Government with guidance on a booster programme within days. Millions of elderly Britons are expected to receive a top-up jab this autumn after data showed a third dose cause a 'several-fold increase' in antibodies, which help fight off the coronavirus. And Government insiders say the third dose people receive will likely be of a different type to their first two doses because the combination will offer better protection. But Dame Sarah Gilbert, who helped create the AstraZeneca jab, today argued a mass vaccine booster campaign like that of Israel and the US may not be necessary because immunity is 'lasting well' for most people, even if their protection against infection may have weakened. And the Oxford University vaccinologist said extra doses reserved for the UK's top-up drive should be directed to countries lagging behind in the global roll-out. Mr Dowden said the UK was already donating spare vaccines and planned to giveaway another 90million. He told Sky News: 'It's interesting because I was at an international conference this week talking to my counterparts. Pretty much all nations are looking at doing a booster programme — Israel are already doing it — so we are not an outlier in doing this.' Health Secretary Sajid Javid yesterday said he expects a booster programme to start later in September but he is still awaiting advice from experts on the scale of any campaign to offer extra shots to people. Ministers originally planned to revaccinate 32million over-50s and give them flu jabs simultaneously. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) yesterday ruled the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs are safe to use as boosters, but the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has yet to give its final advice to ministers. In May, Dr Kluge said: 'The pandemic will be over once we reach 70 per cent minimum coverage in vaccination.' ADVERTISEMENT But asked today whether this number was still the target, or if more people needed to be vaccinated to end the pandemic, Dr Kluge said the situation had changed due to new variants, such as Delta. He said: 'I think it brings us to the point that the aim of a vaccination is first and foremost to prevent more serious disease, and that's mortality. 'If we consider that Covid will continue to mutate and remain with us, the way influenza is, then we should anticipate how to gradually adapt our vaccination strategy to endemic transmission and gather really precious knowledge about the impact of additional jabs.' An endemic level is when there are regular cases of a virus among a population, making the disease spread and rates predictable. But he warned that two doses of the Covid vaccines are crucial 'to unload the pressure from healthcare systems' that desperately need to treat other conditions pushed to the backburner by the pandemic. Data from Public Health England yesterday revealed unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid and 10 times more likely to die from the virus. The vaccines were designed to prevent critical illness and death, rather than stopping transmission. Two doses of the jabs are up to 98 per cent effective at preventing hospitalisations and deaths, according to the most recent estimates from the Government's scientific advisers. But they are thought to be around 40 per cent effective at stopping infected people from passing the virus on. ADVERTISEMENT The Delta variant is considered to be 60 percent more transmissible than the previous dominant variant Alpha, and twice as contagious as the original virus detected in Wuhan. And some strains including Delta and Beta have mutations that make it easier for them to slip past the protection offered by the jabs. This risk, combined with waning immunity among those who received both vaccines at the start of the rollout, led the Government to tell the NHS to prepare for administering third doses of the vaccine at the same time as flu jabs this autumn. Some 32million people were originally expected to receive booster doses — including all over-50s, those most at-risk from the virus and frontline health and social care staff. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation — which advises ministers on the rollout — is yet to make a decision on boosters and is expected to only offer third doses to the most clinically extremely vulnerable. Half a million immunosuppressed people — including blood cancer patients, those with HIV or who have recently had an organ transplant — were invited to get a third dose of the vaccine last week, over concerns they generated low levels of antibodies after two doses. Covid infections in Israel fell sharply this week after the rollout of its mass booster campaign, with hospital admissions and deaths also beginning to trend downwards. Figures compiled by the Oxford University-backed research team Our World in Data show Israel's average daily cases have been falling for the last four days, after peaking at just over 10,000 on September 3 Weekly hospital admissions for patients infected with the virus fell to 1,198 in the seven days ending September 5. This was down 17 per cent on the week ending July 29 (1,438) which was the peak of the country's summer wave The number of people dying with the virus has dropped off after peaking on September 5, when there were an average of 31 fatalities per day. This dropped to 23 yesterday, the same average as the week before on August 31 It comes as Dame Sarah Gilbert, who helped create the AstraZeneca jab, today argued a mass vaccine booster campaign like that of Israel and the US may not be necessary because immunity is 'lasting well' for most people, even if their protection against infection may have weakened. But Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden insisted today that Britain would not be an 'outlier' in terms of dishing out third doses and he expects the JCVI to issue the Government with guidance on a booster programme within days. The country experienced a surge in infections, hospitalisations and deaths last month after it exclusively vaccinated its population with Pfizer injections administered three weeks apart. It comes as the four Chief Medical Officers in each of the UK's nations are considering whether the vaccines should be rollout out to all over-12s in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. The decision was passed to them after the JCVI concluded the health benefits of vaccinating all 12 to 15-year-olds was too small to recommend that all of them receive Covid jabs. ADVERTISEMENT The JCVI can only consider the health benefits to the younger group, while the medical officers can consider wider social and economic benefits, such as the impact of schools having to close if the virus spreads in high levels around classrooms."

The school district, Conseil Scolaire Catholique (CSC) Providence, which operates as the french language school board for southwestern Ontario, originally described the ‘Giving Back To Mother Earth’ program as “a gesture of openness and reconciliation.” The goal was to “[replace] books in [CSC Providence's] libraries that had outdated content and carried negative stereotypes about First Nations, Métis and Inuit people,” said the school board. Titles such as Tintin in America, which was withdrawn for its negative portrayal of Indigenous peoples, alongside biographies of various geographers and explorers were discarded, burned, and used as fertilizer to aid in growing a tree on school property. The program has been ongoing since 2019, but only recently drew criticism. When asked about the program at a campaign stop this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that it’s not up to non-Indigenous people “to tell Indigenous people how they should feel or act to advance reconciliation.” “On a personal level, I would never agree to the burning of books,” he said. In addition to the controversy surrounding the program's destruction of books, CSC Providence told CTV News Toronto that one leader involved, Suzy Kies — the co-chair of the Indigenous peoples' commission of the Liberal Party of Canada — does not in fact have status with Indigenous Services Canada. “CSC Providence has learned of the shocking revelations … about Suzy Kies. We are deeply troubled and concerned,” Lynn Cosette, a communications agent for the school board, told CTV News Toronto. “We firmly believed Kies' claims to be an Indigenous woman from the Wbanaki Confederacy and the Turtle Clan. We were not aware that Suzy Kies does not have Indian status under the act and sincerely believed that we had the opportunity to work with an experienced Indigenous knowledge keeper,” Cosette said. In response to the allegations, Kies has since resigned from her position with the Liberal Party of Canada. CTV News Toronto has reached out to Kies for a statement but has yet to receive a response. Meanwhile, CSC Providence says the revelations have caused them to pause the program and “rethink” their library review process."

It's arguable that, for conservatives, this is just a return to the historical status quo. Most terrorism in American history has been committed by homegrown radicals who are motivated by white supremacy, Christian fundamentalism, or other far-right ideologies. That was true in the late 19th century when President Ulysses Grant unleashed the newly formed Department of Justice to shut down the KKK, which was the terrorism arm of a larger movement to force formerly enslaved people back into second-class citizen status. It was also true in the various periods of American history, such as the 1920s and 30s, when mass lynching became a tool for white supremacists to kneecap Black economic empowerment. Critically, it was true in the decade before the 9/11 attacks, which bore witness to a rise of racist and Christian fundamentalist terrorism, including the targeted shootings of abortion doctors. One of the most famous terrorists of the 1990s was Eric Rudolph, a Christian fundamentalist who bombed abortion clinics, a lesbian bar, and the Atlanta Olympics of 1996, all in protest of what he saw as evil progressive values. Another was Timothy McVeigh, a white supremacist who bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people — 19 of whom were children at the building's daycare — in a strike against what he saw as a ""liberal"" federal government. Now the logic driving McVeigh and Rudolph — that vigilantes should be able to force right-wing views on a public that has rejected them democratically — is becoming the standard operating logic of the Republican party. We see this in the GOP cover-up of Trump's January 6 insurrection. We also see this in the new abortion ban in Texas, which bypasses law enforcement altogether and empowers self-appointed bounty hunters to chase down anyone suspected of helping women abort their pregnancies. After 9/11, there was an effective campaign on the right to erase this extensive history of right-wing violence from the American conception of ""terrorism."" George W. Bush leaned heavily into using ""terror"" as a vague word connecting Islam and violence. The ""war on terror"" was used as cover to invade Iraq, a sovereign nation, and depose their president, even though there was no connection of Iraq or Saddam Hussein to 9/11. Bush's defenders would also pretend like his leadership protected Americans from terrorism, even though Bush's own FBI recorded multiple incidents of domestic terrorism linked to American politics, including the white supremacy and anti-choice movements. It was so bad that the right was able to bully Barack Obama's administration into ignoring that homegrown right-wing terrorism is still terrorism. In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued a memo warning that ""[r]ight-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans."" It wasn't a surprising observation. Just such recruitment is how McVeigh, the most famous terrorist of the 90s, got radicalized. Republicans nonetheless went full tilt in faking outrage, using the ""honor the vets"" cover for what was clearly a campaign to conceal the very real terrorist threat emanating from the extremist right. Unfortunately, the administration caved and withdrew the report, which turned out to be incredibly accurate, as one in five people who were arrested for participating in the January 6 insurrection were veterans. Distorting the word ""terrorism"" to make it a Muslim-only thing served not just the racist purposes of the right, but their own political goals. The sad fact of the matter is that terrorism works. That is true of 9/11, which functioned exactly how Osama bin Laden wanted it to, by provoking an American overreaction that would radicalize young Muslims to his holy war. And it's true stateside, as demonstrated by the way the ""mainstream"" anti-choice movement works in tandem with terrorists to scare doctors away from providing abortion, a relationship which became even more explicit after the Texas ban. The January 6 insurrection proves this unfortunate truth once again, as evidenced by the Republicans who have stuck by Trump and denied the seriousness of the terrorist attack he incited. Running cover for domestic terrorists pays political dividends for Republicans, as those folks are using violence to achieve conservative political ends that more peaceful legislative means cannot. Trump had what you might call a friendly relationship to the terrorist impulse from the very beginning. Trump's unsubtle winking and nodding to white supremacist terrorism started early during his campaign, in August 2015, when he praised two supporters who beat up a Mexican-American man by calling them ""passionate"" and saying they ""love this country."" He proceeded to escalate for years, most infamously when he called neo-Nazi rioters ""fine people"" in 2017 and culminating on January 6, when he incited the assault on the Capitol. It is true that, in the face of rising white supremacist terrorist acts like the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018 or the El Paso Walmart shooting of 2019, all linked to racist rhetoric Trump and his supporters routinely espoused, it became harder and harder to pretend that white supremacist terrorism wasn't a real thing that was killing real people. Even Trump's appointed FBI director, Christopher Wray, admitted to Congress in 2019 that, ""A majority of the domestic terrorism cases we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence."" Despite all this, Republicans have stood by Trump and refused to admit that what he's unleashing on the U.S. fits the definition of ""terrorism."" On the contrary, Republicans have only doubled down on equating the word ""terrorism"" with that single strain of political violence committed by Islamic extremists. Even worse, many conservative pundits and Republican politicians have become even freer than they were during the Bush administration in conflating all Muslims everywhere with terrorists, which is the equivalent of saying all Christians are terrorists because of Eric Rudolph. We see this in the demagoguery around the admission of Afghan refugees to the U.S. after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, which Republican politicians and Fox News pundits have routinely equated with allowing, as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said, ""terrorists coming across the border."" This is the same McCarthy who tried to block an investigation of the January 6 attack, and who continues to buddy up to Trump, the man who instigated the whole thing. It makes a grim sort of sense that Republicans are growing increasingly anti-democratic. They can't win people over by persuasion and so turn to blunt force in order to get their way. The GOP increasingly leans on the same logic as terrorists. That's why their anti-voting laws have echoes of the Jim Crow laws that were coupled with racist terrorism in the past. And that's why their new abortion law relies on right-wing vigilantism. Mother Jones recently released an important video of their reporter Becca Andrews connecting the Texas law to the Capitol insurrection and right-wing militias, all rooted in a terroristic approach to gaining power. In an atmosphere of what pundits delicately call ""political polarization,"" it's an open question of whether the word ""terrorism"" can be meaningful used anymore. A huge bulk of American terrorism is related to the Republican Party, and not just because domestic terrorists and Republican politicians have the same general policy platform. We literally experienced a terrorist attack meant to gain the White House for a Republican who lost the election. But the American conception of ""terrorism"" has always been one of fringe actors lashing out against the powerful, not as a support system to help the powerful gain more power. It's been 20 years since 9/11, but it's still an open question whether we can update our image of ""terrorism"" to encompass what it really looks like in 2021."

But the next time an eruption of mass and energy from the sun is likely to hit Earth, it could cause an Internet blackout lasting for months, according to new research. A paper by Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi at the SIGCOMM 2021 data communication conference has postulated the likelihood of a solar storm hitting the planet. Jyothi, who is based at the University of California, Irvine, says that the storm could actually be a solar superstorm, comparing it to a black swan event. What are solar storms? Solar storms are massive eruptions of plasma and charged particles that are blasted into space from the sun. These eruptions, which comprise flares, prominences, sunspots, and coronal mass ejections (CME) can overwhelm the Earth’s atmosphere if they occur in sufficiently large quantities. While the Earth’s atmosphere can normally act as a defence against harmful radiation, if it gets overwhelmed by the solar storm, the result could be devastating. The harmful particles of the solar storm can produce their own magnetic fields, which could modify the Earth's magnetic field and affect compass readings. It could also dump particles in the Earth’s atmosphere that can cause an Aurora on the planet, like the northern lights. It could also produce massive electrical surges in power grids and induce electricity in long pipelines. What does the new research say? The research paper, titled “Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse” states that a possibility of 1.6 to 12 percent exists that a solar storm with sufficient strength to cause catastrophic disruption could occur within the next decade. Apart from causing significant damage to the planet's Internet infrastructure, the storm could also impact power grids throughout the world. It could also cause severe damage to repeaters, used for strengthening signals in long-distance fibre optic cables, and the massive undersea cables that provide Internet connectivity between continents. Has the Earth ever faced a solar storm? Very little data is presently available on solar storms. Only three large storms have been recorded to date, with the most recent one in 2014. The Earth has escaped relatively unscathed from such storms. The most severe solar storm, known as the Carrington Event, was recorded in 1859. The storm led to compasses going haywire globally, while the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights were seen in Colombia, which falls near the equator."

The departure from Kabul to Doha on a chartered Qatar Airways flight on Thursday marked “a positive first step” with the new regime, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said. “The Taliban have been cooperative in facilitating the departure of American citizens and lawful permanent residents on charter flights from HKIA,” she said in a statement, referring to Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport. “They have shown flexibility, and they have been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort.” Nearly 40 US citizens or permanent residents were invited to board the flight but only 21 were on board, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a tweet late on Thursday. “Of course we would like to see more such flights,” he had said earlier. “We have heard public statements that more, in fact, maybe forthcoming.” The United States had previously said that a little more than 100 Americans were believed to remain in Afghanistan after President Joe Biden ended the 20-year military mission in August. Price said that most Americans remaining had connections in Afghanistan and had to make “wrenching” decisions on whether to leave and did not need to decide now. “This opportunity doesn't expire if they turn it down one day if they change their mind the next or even next year,” Price said. Around-the-clock airlift in the final two weeks of the war shuttled more than 123,000 people, including most Americans in Afghanistan. Horne said the United States “facilitated” Thursday's departure of Americans from Afghanistan and thanked Qatar for its role in the effort. “We have been working intensely” to ensure the safe departure, and the flight is the result of “careful and hard diplomacy and engagement,” she said. The flight comes two days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Qatar, the transit point for around half of the people airlifted from Afghanistan. Biden and his administration have come under fierce criticism for having left Americans at the mercy of the Taliban. Representative Mike Waltz and Senator Lindsey Graham, both fierce Republican critics of the withdrawal, welcomed the Qatari flight. But they added in a joint statement that “it was inexcusable that the Biden administration allowed a terrorist regime to dictate the terms of allowing Americans to leave on their own with their families."" ""The United States does not take orders from terrorists,” they said. Former president Donald Trump's administration reached an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw troops and froze efforts to let Afghan allies immigrate to the United States."

With house prices continuing to soar, a serious shortage of affordable rental accommodation and long waiting lists for social housing, action is needed to make ending the crisis a top priority, the organisers say. ‘People are now realizing that is not their fault if they cannot find a home or pay for one,’ organiser Sander van der Kraan said earlier this week. ‘They are the victims of years of neo-liberal policy.’ For years problems on the housing market have been dismissed as external issues, such as pollution and immigration, Van der Kraan said. ’The problems were all seen as being so big and complex that politicians could absolve themselves of any blame.’ In particular, the organisers say the government should stop the extra tax on housing corporations so they can invest more in building new social housing. Measures should be taken to restrict the role of private investors and rents in the non-rent controlled sector should also be regulated. Starters A report by ING out on Friday showed that people starting out on the housing ladder are particularly hard hit by the shortage of places to live. ‘They are being forced to rent expensive properties and are delaying their future plans, such as having a family,’ ING spokesman Wim Flikweert told the Telegraaf. ING surveyed 1,100 home owners and new entrants to the market. One in three said they had been waiting for more than 18 months to find an affordable place to buy. Almost a quarter said finding a new home was a matter of urgency because where they were living was either too expensive or did not meet their needs. In Amsterdam, for example €1,500 for a small flat in a popular area has come to be considered the norm, even though rents have fallen slightly during the pandemic. Rotterdam The role of private investors is also being called into question and next year legislation which will stop them buying up cheap and mid-priced homes in certain areas will come into effect. Local broadcaster RTV Rijnmond said earlier this week that 38% of houses coming on the market in Rotterdam were bought by investors who planned to rent them out rather than live in them. Amsterdam has already published plans to bring in local rules requiring people to live in a property if they buy it. The city council is also considering buying up stocks of social housing that come up for sale in order to keep rents affordable. One million homes In February, a consortium of 34 developers, construction companies, lobby groups, housing corporations and tenants associations formed a massive alliance to tackle the housing shortage in the Netherlands. In total, they say that one million new homes need to be built in the Netherlands in the next 10 years to meet demand. The organisations hope their plans will form the backbone of the next government’s strategy on housing. Current government strategy involves realising 75,000 new homes a year through new build and converting other buildings. More density  However, a report last month by research group Platform 31 suggested the Netherlands could offset some of the shortage of housing in the short term by making better use of its current housing stock. Some 40% of dwellings are currently lived in by one person, and the average amount of space is around 65 square metres each – almost 20 square metres more than in Germany or Belgium, the report pointed out.

Born in 1953 in Bazarak, the provincial capital of Panjshir province, Ahmad Shah Massoud was a military strategist and commander who was referred to as the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ and ‘Afghan Napoleon‘. A former engineering student in Kabul, he helped unite the resistance in Panjshir Valley and fought off the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989. When the Taliban took over and declared the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in 1996, he and his resistance — the Northern Alliance — put up a valiant effort against it. A report in The New York Times notes that by 1999, 85-90 per cent of Afghanistan was under the Taliban control but not Panjshir Valley. Massoud and his forces had retained several strongholds and put up strong defences in the region. Two days before 9/11 attacks, Massoud was assassinated by an al Qaeda suicide squad posing as journalists. On the pretense of shooting a documentary, the terrorists met with Massoud. However, before he could answer a question, they detonated bombs which investigators later said had been disguised as camera equipment, notes a France 24 report. Shah Massoud’s son, Ahmad Massoud, is now fighting the Taliban in the Panjshir Valley. He leads the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, which constitutes about 9,000-10,000 trained fighters.

Google executives have been aware since at least May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with local laws in the UK, Europe and Asia that mandate temporary workers be paid equal rates to full-time employees performing similar work, internal Google documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian show. But rather than immediately correct the errors, the company dragged its feet for more than two years, the documents show, citing concern about the increased cost to departments that rely heavily on temporary workers, potential exposure to legal claims, and fear of negative press attention. Google executives and attorneys at one point pursued a plan to come into compliance slowly and at the least possible cost to itself, despite acknowledging that such a move was not “the correct outcome from a compliance perspective” and could place the staffing companies it contracts with “in a difficult position, legally and ethically”. Google admitted the failures and said it would conduct an investigation after being contacted by the Guardian. “While the team hasn’t increased the comparator rate benchmarks for some years, actual pay rates for temporary staff have increased numerous times in that period,” said Spyro Karetsos, Google’s chief compliance officer, in a statement. “Most temporary staff are paid significantly more than the comparator rates. “Nevertheless, it’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company. We’re doing a thorough review, and we’re committed to identifying and addressing any pay discrepancies that the team has not already addressed. “And we’ll be conducting a review of our compliance practices in this area. In short, we’re going to figure out what went wrong here, why it happened, and we’re going to make it right.” A whistleblower represented by Whistleblower Aid has filed a complaint about the alleged violations with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. While international labor law is not under the purview of the SEC, the complaint alleges that Google’s failure to disclose the pay parity liabilities, which it estimates could amount to $100m, constitute material misstatements in its quarterly financial reports, a violation of US securities law. “The disclosure makes it clear that Google hasn’t just broken labor laws around the world, but has misled investors about major legal and financial liabilities,” said John Tye, founder and chief disclosure officer of Whistleblower Aid. “The lawful, anonymous whistleblower disclosure is a critical step toward ensuring that Google is held to account. We urge the SEC to bring an enforcement action against Google, and protect the rights of investors to receive complete and accurate information.” The issue stems from Google’s extensive reliance on what it calls its “extended workforce”, as well as the plethora of local laws that govern how such workers must be treated in the dozens of countries where Google operates. Google maintains a workforce of more than 100,000 temps, vendors and contractors who are not directly employed by the company, but who perform work on its behalf, on tasks ranging from food service and security to coding and data analysis. The vast majority of these workers are “vendors” who work on long-term projects that are wholly managed by the vendor company, such as content moderation, and have little interaction with Google employees. But at any given time, Google also employs thousands of temporary workers. While they are paid by staffing agencies, temps report directly to Google managers. The departments that rely most heavily on temporary workers include recruiting, marketing and Waymo, Google’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary. Globally, Google spends about $800m annually on temporary workers. The use of contingent workers is common in the tech industry, but Google’s reliance on a “shadow workforce” that outnumbers its direct employee base has long drawn criticism from the company’s own employees, as well as politicians and labor unions. More than 30 countries, including the UK, the EU member states, India and Taiwan, have enacted “pay parity” or “equal treatment” laws that require temporary workers to be treated equally to full-time employees (FTEs) who perform the same or similar work, according to Google’s internal guidance on the laws. The US, where the majority of Google’s temps are based, does not have any such protections. In general, these laws require equivalent treatment of temps and FTEs when it comes to pay, hours, breaks, vacation, holidays and certain perks. In the UK, pay parity is required after a 12-week qualifying period, for example, while in Ireland it is mandated from the first day of work. Some countries also mandate equivalency for benefits and bonuses. The staffing agency and the hirer – in this case, Google – share the responsibility for ensuring equitable treatment, but it is the hirer’s responsibility to provide the agency with accurate data about the pay rates. In 2012 and 2013, Google undertook an exercise to map all its temporary roles in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) with the comparable Google full-time roles, according to the internal memo. The exercise produced “comparator” rates that Google then provided to the staffing agencies that recruit and employ its temporary staff. The company performed a similar exercise for temp roles in APAC (Asia Pacific) in 2017. Since those exercises were carried out, compensation for full-time Google employees has increased substantially. The median total compensation rose more than 38%, from $197,274 to $273,493, between 2017 and 2020, according to SEC filings. But the comparator rates were never updated. “Ideally this would be done annually,” reads the internal Google memo on the issue, which acknowledges that it is Google’s obligation to keep the information up to date. By 15 May 2019, the problem was known to Adrienne Crowther, the executive responsible for Google’s extended workforce team (xWS), her comments on the internal memo show. “Yikes! This seems WAY too old,” she wrote in response to the “2012-2013” date of the comparator data. “Agreed,” responded Alan Barry, a compliance manager for Google’s extended workforce team. Barry went on to suggest that xWS “refresh” the data as part of a larger project working on ensuring accurate mapping between temporary and full-time positions. Scale of the problem Given the high turnover rate of temporary workers, the number of workers affected by Google’s failure could be in the tens of thousands. One document shows that, as of 16 February 2021, Google had 1,030 temporary workers in countries with pay parity laws, the largest numbers in the UK (343), India (222), Ireland (207) and Germany (59). That document – an audit of countries with pay parity laws performed for Google by Deloitte – highlighted another problem with the company’s legal compliance. Deloitte reported that pay-parity laws had been enacted in 16 countries where Google was employing more than 350 temporary workers without providing equal treatment rates, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Switzerland and Taiwan. Google’s underpayments to its temporary workers are substantial. One internal analysis estimated that Google’s expenses for 1,200 temps in EMEA and APAC regions would need to increase by $17.3m to comply with pay parity laws, of which $12.65m would go to the temporary workers in increased wages and bonuses. (An additional $4.4m in costs would be the result of the estimated 35% markup that staffing agencies charge.) But that analysis was based on a proposal to correct the rates for new hires only, without providing raises and back pay to existing and previous temp workers for the time they worked at the incorrect rates, suggesting that the total amount of lost wages to current and past workers is significantly higher. Individual temps were paid between 12% and 50% less than they should have been, according to an internal memo also from February 2021. Another document showed that temporary workers in Google’s human resources department in the UK were paid between £4.10 and £8.25 less per hour than they should have been, with some temps earning £14.17 instead of £18.27 and others earning £21.56 instead of £29.80. Google’s delay in addressing the rates could hurt former temporary workers’ ability to seek redress. Under the UK’s Agency Worker Regulations 2010, temps can appeal to an employment tribunal if they believe their rights have been breached, but they must do so within three months. In Ireland, appeals to the rights commissioner are supposed to be made within six months. “These agency workers have been the victims of wage theft,” said Matthew Creagh, an employment rights policy officer for the Trades Union Council, who criticized the UK’s lack of a state regulator to enforce worker protections. “How will they be compensated? Often the discussion veers towards punishing employers, which is good, but getting the agency workers their money is overlooked.” Internal debate Though executives in Google’s xWS department were aware by May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with the law and underpaying workers, the company did not move quickly to correct the rates and provide back wages to those who were owed them. Instead, it spent at least two years continuing to pay out-of-date rates while it debated internally how to come back into legal compliance without admitting what had happened, documents and emails show. Leaders of the xWS team appeared keenly aware that admitting the problem would damage its reputation within Google by causing headaches for departments whose budgets would be effected, as well as with the staffing agencies that are liable for providing pay parity. They also expressed interest in preventing existing and former temp workers from knowing they had been underpaid, in order to prevent claims for back pay. By October 2020, xWS executives, including Crowther and Deepak Negi, another director, and Google’s employment counsels for EMEA and APAC had signed off on a plan to correct the rates, emails and documents show. The company would pursue a “natural correction” of the temp rates, whereby new joiners started at correct rates while existing temps remained at the lower rates, rather than an “immediate correction”, whereby all temps had their rates adjusted to the correct levels. The plan had received support from executives and attorneys due to “the current low risk of a parity claim, the ability to correct rates and not make a great deal of noise, and the ability to correct rates without immediate substantial financial impact to [Google’s departments],” an xWS operations manager promoting it wrote in an email. Some xWS staffers appear to have resisted the proposal, noting that it would result in groups of temps performing similar work earning significantly different wages. Some also worried that the staffing agencies, who are responsible for complying with pay parity laws, might ask questions about the changed rates, or even object. But in an extraordinary December 2020 email, Barry, the attorney responsible for compliance in xWS, endorsed the “natural correction” despite acknowledging that it was insufficient. “We know that the impacted workers are not on the correct 2020 rates, nor were they in 2019,” he wrote. “So, strictly speaking, from the point that we put ourselves on notice as to the correct comparator rate, it should apply to both the incumbents as well as the new joiners. To do otherwise may place our staffing partners in a difficult position, legally and ethically.” “In my view, while [an immediate correction] does appear to be the correct outcome from a compliance perspective, I recognise the barriers to this,” Barry wrote. “The cost is significant and it would give rise to a flurry of noise/frustration on the part of the [Google departments] who have not accounted for the changed cost. I’m also not keen to invite the charge that we’ve allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant … I am leaning towards favouring [the natural correction] – but with careful thought and consideration needed as to how we communicate it to the [staffing agencies].” By February 2021, Barry and others were considering a third option beyond the “natural” and “immediate” corrections: applying the new rates to new joiners and existing temps and backdating the increases for the existing temps to their start date. (None of the options included providing back pay to temps who had been underpaid but no longer worked for Google.) The memo suggests that Barry and the xWS team’s concerns remained primarily reputational. It includes guidance from Google’s employment lawyers that “the threat of litigation is greater than the prospect of actual litigation” since actual litigation would require temps to know that they were being underpaid, and by how much. “If and when they become aware they will seek recompense but will want to avoid litigation. Strategy should therefore be driven by an assessment of the internal PR/reputational risk and the risk of pay disparity becoming known within our temps population.” Nevertheless, Barry argued that despite the “significant” financial cost and potential for criticism of xWS from Google and staffing agencies, he now believed that this third option was the best course. “In my view – better to opt to for option three in a controlled fashion now, than in an uncontrolled fashion later,” he wrote."

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is meeting in Marseille, does not set global policy, but its recommendations have in the past served as the backbone for UN treaties and conventions. They will help set the agenda for upcoming UN summits on food systems, biodiversity and climate change. - Saving the Amazon - An emergency motion calling for four-fifths of the Amazon basin to be declared a protected area by 2025 -- submitted by COICA, an umbrella group representing more than two million indigenous peoples across nine South American nations -- passed with overwhelming support. ""Indigenous Peoples have come to defend our home and, in doing so, defend the planet. This motion is a first step,"" said Jose Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, general coordinator of COICA and a leader of the Curripaco people in Venezuela. Over the last two decades, the Amazon has lost roughly 10,000 square kilometres every year to deforestation, much of it through fires set deliberately to clear land for commercial agriculture or cattle grazing. This destruction combined with climate change, scientists have warned, could push the world's largest tropical forest irretrievably past a ""tipping point"" into a savannah-like landscape. - '30% by 2030' - Another hotly debated measure that was accepted in a vote of IUCN members -- government agencies, NGOs and indigenous people's organisations -- says that 30 of the planet's land and ocean area should have protected status within a decade. The zones selected must include ""biodiversity hotspots"" teaming with animal and plant life, and be backed up by rigorous monitoring and enforcement, the resolution says. Many scientists and conservationists advocated for an even more ambitious ""half-Earth"" target. ""Passage of this motion sends a clear signal to world leaders that the '30 by 30' target, and respect for indigenous and local community rights, must be agreed to at COP15,"" said Campaign for Nature director Brian O'Donnell, referring to a UN biodiversity summit tasked with delivering a treaty next May to protect nature. The pace at which animal and plant species are going extinct is 100 to 1,000 times the normal ""background"" rate, a widely accepted threshold for the kind of mass-extinction event that has only occurred five times in the last half-billion years. - Deep-sea mining - The IUCN's 1,400 members overwhelmingly approved a resolution recommending a moratorium on deep sea mining and reform of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a intergovernmental regulatory body. Industry argued that the unattached rocks on the ocean floor some five kilometres below the waves are a greener source of minerals -- manganese, cobalt, nickel -- needed to build electric vehicle batteries. But scientists counter that seabed ecosystems at that depth are fragile, and could take decades or longer to heal once disrupted. The measure passed with more than 80 percent of votes from government agencies, and 90 percent support from NGOs and civil society groups. ""The resounding Yes in support for a global freeze on deep seabed mining is a clear signal that there is no social licence to open the deep seafloor to mining,"" said Jessica Battle, lead of the WWF's Deep Sea Mining Initiative. - Climate change commission? - The major drivers of species decline and extinction are habitat loss, hunting for food, poaching for animal parts, invasive species and environmental pollution. But climate change is starting to loom large as a threat to wildlife, leading members to vote in a motion for the creation of a climate change commission within the IUCN. The aim is to ""bring together the world's experts on climate change to help shape the agenda around species,"" said Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN's Red List Unit. ""The climate and biodiversity emergencies are not distinct, but two aspects of one crisis,"" a draft version of the congress's final manifesto said. - Programmed extinction - On Friday, following intense and prolonged debate, the congress endorsed a motion on ""synthetic biology"" -- an umbrella term for genetic engineering -- that tilts towards those in favour of more research and experimentation. One technology in particular that causes local extinction of a species, called gene drive, has divided conservationists. Proponents say it is the best tool available to fight invasive species of rodents, snakes and mosquitos that have already wiped out dozens of species of birds and other vertebrates on island habitats. Opponents fear genetically modified animals could find their way to other continents, or share mutated genes with other species. ""There are obvious ecological risks and concerns regarding genetic modification of wild species"", said Ricarda Steinbrecher, a geneticist working with the NGO Pro-Natura. © 2021 AFP"

So we will not recognise this law of the Chinese,” Lorenzana said during an event marking the Philippines’ Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the United States. Lorenzana made the statement as he continues his visit to the United States to press for a review of the MDT and to lobby for more advanced military equipment for the Philippines in the face of Chinese territorial threat. China, which claims historical rights over most of the areas in the South China Sea, amended its Maritime Traffic Safety Law in recent months. It took effect on September 1. The law requires all foreign vessels sailing in the South China Sea to report their information to Chinese authorities. A 2016 ruling at The Hague said China’s claim over most of the South China Sea has no legal basis, but Beijing has ignored the decision and has continued to expand its presence in the area, building artificial islands complete with runways and docks, igniting more tensions with neighbouring countries. Several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, have overlapping claims with China in the South China Sea. On Monday, the Chinese state-owned publication Global Times reported that the revised maritime law has taken effect as of September 1. It covers five types of vessels including submersibles, nuclear vessels, ships carrying radioactive materials, ships carrying bulk oil, chemicals, liquefied gas and other toxic and harmful substances, and other vessels “that might endanger China’s maritime traffic safety”, according to the Global Times. Beijing clarified that the new law does not hinder freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. But the US calls it a “serious threat”, and a foreign policy expert has described it as an attempt by China to force other countries to submit to its control by reporting their ships to Chinese authorities. In January, China also passed the Coast Guard Law that for the first time explicitly allows its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels within their jurisdiction. Upgrade, update Amid concerns over China’s growing dominance in the South China Sea, the Philippines, a longtime ally of the US, wants Washington to increase its military commitments. Lorenzana, the Philippine defence chief, said it is time for a comprehensive review of Manila’s alliance with the US, saying the Philippines is getting less from its relationship with Washington than even non-treaty allies. He said there is a need to “upgrade” and “update” the alliance and to make clear the “extent of American commitments”. “Some questions being asked in Manila are, do we still need the MDT; should we amend it,” he told Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies on Wednesday, referring to the 1951 pact. “What is clear is that we need a comprehensive review of our alliance.” Lorenzana pointed out that the US treaty with Japan, its World War II enemy, was more explicit than that with Manila when it came to determining whether it applied in the Pacific maritime area, where the Philippines has come under increasing pressure from China over rival territorial claims. He said this explained why seven out of 10 Filipinos supported President Rodrigo Duterte’s call for engagement with China rather than confrontation and more than half doubted US reliability as an ally in South China Sea disputes.   Lorenzana said US-Philippines relations would “have to evolve in recognition of new geopolitical realities, most especially the rise of China”. He said Manila and Washington should consider revising the MDT and other defence pacts to ensure both could better respond to “grey zone threats” like state-sanctioned Chinese maritime militia forces that have been intimidating smaller states. Previously, Duterte had also blamed the US for failing to enforce an agreement it mediated between Beijing and Manila regarding the simultaneous withdrawal of naval forces from the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which until 2012 was administered by the Philippines. China took over control of Scarborough Shoal after the Philippines withdrew from the area after obtaining a promise from the US. China and the Philippines were supposed to withdraw their troops from Scarborough Shoal, but Beijing did not honour the agreement, and Washington did not enforce it. US reluctance Manila has repeatedly protested what it calls the “illegal” and “threatening” presence of hundreds of Chinese “maritime militia” vessels inside its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as defined by a 2016 ruling at The Hague. Hundreds of Chinese vessels were spotted sailing within the Philippine EEZ on several occasions this year, prompting an angry reaction from Manila. But Duterte had also said the Philippines cannot afford to confront Beijing militarily. In his statement from Washington, DC, Lorenzana echoed Duterte’s complaints about the US reluctance to supply the Philippines with state-of-the-art weaponry. He said Manila was in the mid of an unprecedented military modernisation programme and needed to move beyond Vietnam War-era hardware that had been provided by Washington in the past.

Perhaps, a longtime ally like the Philippines, facing major adversaries in Asia, deserves as much, if not more, assistance and commitment,” he said. Lorenzana’s remarks came after Duterte in July restored the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) governing movement of US troops in and out of the country, something strategically vital for American efforts to counter China. While there are no more US bases in the Philippines, the two countries hold annual military exercises until Duterte issued his threat to end the pact last year. Duterte had pledged to terminate the VFA after Washington denied a visa to a Philippine senator who is an ally of the president. For Washington, having the ability to rotate troops through the VFA is important not only for the defence of the Philippines, but also strategically when it comes to countering China in the region. In July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated a warning to China that an attack on Philippine armed forces in the South China Sea would trigger the mutual defence treaty."

Home and EV chargers in England Specifically, all new homes and offices will have to feature “smart” charging devices that can automatically charge vehicles during off-peak periods. New office blocks will need to install a charge point for every five parking spaces. The new law will make England the first country in the world to require all new homes to have EV chargers. It will also boost confidence in helping those who transition from gas cars to overcome range anxiety, as so many homes in England don’t have off-street parking or garages. The proposal is part of the movement to rapidly boost the number of chargers across England ahead of the UK’s 2030 ban of new fossil-fuel vehicles. The government originally announced a proposal to mandate that all new homes have a charge point with a parking space in 2019, as Electrek then reported. Nigel Pocklington, CEO of clean energy company Good Energy, said [via Business Green]: Flexible charging at home and at workplace during the day is going to be crucial to decarbonizing not just transport but the UK’s entire energy system. As will better energy efficiency, electrified heating and solar power on 13.5 million homes – we hope to see all these as part of the plans for new homes, too. The home and office EV charger mandate is expected to start in 2022. Further, the UK government announced a free app called EV8 Switch yesterday, on World EV Day: It calculates how much money UK drivers could save by switching to an EV compared to their current petrol or diesel vehicle, along with details on the carbon dioxide (CO2) savings and air quality improvements they could achieve. Drivers can also see which electric vehicles would be the most suitable for them based on their current vehicle and how switching to electric could fit in with their current lifestyle. Those with the app can also see how close their nearest charge points are, and which journeys can be completed without the need to top up en route. Electrek’s Take Having been the owner of Tudor, Victorian, Edwardian, and new-build homes in the UK, I have experienced firsthand what it’s like to live with both on- and offroad parking and completely support this decision. My new-build home had solar panels on it already, and if it had come with an EV charger, it definitely would have served as an incentive for us to switch to electric, even five years ago. When you don’t have off-road parking, then it will be reassuring to have charging at your office. And one charger for every five parking spaces means less fighting with your colleagues over who gets to use them. This incentive should really help to boost people’s confidence so that they more readily embrace switching to an EV. And hey, it’s not like people have petrol stations at their homes. To be able to power up your car at home is fantastic. Photo: BP Pulse FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Police officers working at Andrew’s Windsor home took in an affidavit of service on August 27, according to an update on the case published today. It means the prince could have just 21 days to respond to the allegations or face a default judgment. Virginia Giuffre – previously Roberts – has launched a civil suit in the US, alleging she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was 17. Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and claims he has no recollection of even meeting Mrs Giuffre. The latest papers say a man called Cesar Sepulveda, acting on behalf of Mrs Giuffre’s lawyers, first tried to serve the prince with the documents at his home at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, on August 26. The representative was met by police officers who said they had been instructed not to let anyone onto the property or accept service of any court processes. They said they were unable to reach the defendant’s private secretary or anyone senior. It appeared they had been ‘primed’ to reject such requests, the documents said. Police officers at Andrew’s London home took the paperwork (Picture: PA) Mr Sepulveda was advised that anything left with the officers would not be forwarded to the defendant. He was given the number for Andrew’s solicitor and left a message but did not receive a response. The document states Mr Sepulveda returned the next morning and again met with police officers who this time agreed to accept the documents at the main gate. He was assured they would be passed on to the duke’s legal team. The document states that Mr Sepulveda ‘did enquire whether it was possible to meet personally with the defendant, but he was told the was not possible and although (Sepulveda) did ask the whereabouts of the defendant, the Metropolitan Police Officer said that he could not answer any questions.’ Virginia Giuffre says she is a victim of Jeffrey Epstein (Picture: Reuters) It had been thought the lawyers would have to serve Andrew with the paperwork in person, but the document states the lawyers believe the process they followed complies with English law. It is unclear whether the duke’s lawyers will agree that the legal papers have been served on him, as they were not handed to him personally. The lawsuit claims Ms Giuffre was forced to have sex with Andrew three times after she was trafficked by convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew has not yet responded to the lawsuit (Picture: PA) It lists Ms Giuffre, who was classed as a minor under state law at the time, as the plaintiff and the defendant as ‘Prince Andrew, Duke of York a/k/a Andrew Albert Christian Edward’. It states: ‘Prince Andrew intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was a minor. ‘On multiple occasions Prince Andrew intentionally touched (Roberts) in an offensive and sexual manner without her consent’. Andrew, who has stepped back from royal duties in light of the allegations, was last seen arriving at the royal Scottish retreat of Balmoral Castle in August. It is thought his stay with the Queen was in part intended to ‘avoid’ being served the papers in person. Buckingham Palace refused to comment. A spokeswoman representing Andrew also declined to comment.

The country has built more than 500 dams in the past two decades which, to the Turkish government, is a mark of prosperity and development in the arid southeast. The largest dam on the Tigris river is the Ilisu Dam, whose reservoir covers the ancient Turkish town of Hasankeyf. In 2019, when Turkey began filling the Ilisu, downstream levels on the Tigris were significantly curbed, contributing to a crisis of water-related illnesses in the southern Iraqi city of Basra.

Credit: Courtesy of European Rivers Network This year, delegations from Iraq’s Ministry of Water Resources visited Turkey to press officials to release more water from upstream dams. Turkish officials returned the visit and formed a working group to improve Iraq’s water infrastructure. But some Kurdish authorities in Syria and Iraq are accusing Turkey of using water as a weapon within the larger context of ongoing regional conflict. “Turkey is not using water as a weapon,” said Dursun Yildiz, president of the Ankara-based Hydropolitics Association. He said most of Turkey’s large dams are hydroelectric ones that do impact the environment — but don’t necessarily consume a lot of water. Water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs more rapidly than in non-dammed rivers, however. To Yildiz, the bigger issue is that there are few clear agreements between the countries about how the water is shared, and few efforts to make water systems more efficient. Years ago, while working as a director for Turkey’s State Hydraulics Works, he said, he saw firsthand how efforts to establish clearer, more cohesive water-sharing rules between Turkey, Iraq and Syria were unsuccessful in the past. This region has always had water shortages, Yildiz said. And things are likely to get worse with rapid climate change.

Still, they keep digging — an investment few farmers can afford. “I wish you could come and see it,” he said in a phone call. “Otherwise, you might think that I’m exaggerating.” Editor's note: Saif Al-Aani provided translations from Arabic."

Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Google underpaid thousands of international contract workers, violating pay-parity laws in several countries, The New York Times and The Guardian reported Friday. The tech giant's compliance department discovered the mistake but chose not to immediately compensate the underpaid temporary staff, according to the reports, and instead only corrected rates for new employees in the hopes of avoiding legal, financial, and reputational damage. Alan Barry, a Google manager based in Ireland, feared that the dramatic pay increase would cause employees to ""connect the dots"" and ""give rise to a flurry of noise/frustration,"" according to internal emails reviewed by the Times. ""I'm also not keen to invite the charge that we've allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant,"" Barry wrote in an email, per NYT. Pay-parity labor laws in Europe and Asia require companies to pay equitable wages to full-time and temporary workers who perform similar workplace duties, a protocol that does not exist in the US. According to The Guardian, Google employs over 900 temporary workers throughout the UK, Ireland, India, Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Poland — all of which enforce local pay-parity laws. ""While the team hasn't increased the comparator rate benchmarks for some years, actual pay rates for temporary staff have increased numerous times in that period,"" Spyro Karetsos, Google's chief compliance officer, said in a statement to Insider. ""Most temporary staff are paid significantly more than the comparator rates.""  ""Nevertheless, it's clear that this process has not been handled consistently with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company,"" he added. ""We're doing a thorough review, and we're committed to identifying and addressing any pay discrepancies that the team has not already addressed. And we'll be conducting a review of our compliance practices in this area. In short, we're going to figure out what went wrong here, why it happened, and we're going to make it right."" Google's temporary and contract workers reportedly outnumber its force of full-time employees, creating a ""shadow workforce"" that has attempted unionizing in recent years to fight for fair wages and benefits, Insider's Katie Canales reported. In some cases, Google barred contractors from communicating with full-time Googlers and made temps wear red badges that one employee said led to a ""sense of shame"" among the company's temporary workforce, Insider's Nick Bastone reported in 2019. The New York Times and The Guardian both reported that the issue has been flagged to the SEC, as even though the same pay-parity laws do not exist in America, the lack of public disclosure of the issue could be viewed as a material impact to Google's business, and one that should have been mentioned in company filings."

That's just one of many shocking figures from the Meat Atlas 2021, a comprehensive look at the meat industry released by European nonprofits the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, Friends of the Earth Europe and BUND Tuesday. ""Europeans today eat an average of 66 kilograms (approximately 146 pounds) of meat per year per capita, which is almost twice as much as the World Health Organization actually recommends, and this persistently high consumption and production also comes with immense social and ecological costs,"" Lisa Tostado, head of the International Climate, Trade & Agriculture Policy Programme for Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, said at a public launch event. ""And to raise awareness, provide information, and also foster a nuanced debate on the livestock center, the Heinrich-Böll Foundation and Friends of the Earth have compiled facts and figures on meat."" Launch of the Meat Atlas 2021: Facts and figures about the animals we eat www.youtube.com Listen to the Science  The Meat Atlas 2021 is a comprehensive account of the industry's impact on environmental and public health, totaling more than 70 pages and covering more than 30 topics from land use to greenhouse gas emissions to pesticides. These impacts include: Climate Change: The food and farming sector in industrialized countries accounts for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. The livestock sector alone is responsible for 14.5 percent of global emissions: 45 percent of that from feed production and processing, 39 percent from methane release from ruminants and 10 percent from the storage and management of manure. In fact, 20 top livestock companies together emit more than Germany, the UK or France. Land Use Change: Meat and milk require more land than any other consumer product, and 77 percent of agricultural land is used for either livestock or livestock feed. This means that the expansion of livestock agriculture is a major driver of land conflicts that displace Indigenous and traditional communities. The conversion of land into cattle pasture drives at least two-thirds of deforestation in the Amazon region, for example. Public Health: The coronavirus pandemic has drawn attention to the dangers of zoonotic diseases, diseases that pass from animals to humans. Almost 75 percent of these diseases can be traced to wildlife, and the land grabs of the meat and dairy industry increase the chance that humans will encounter new zoonotic diseases as habitat is destroyed. The rampant use of antibiotics in agriculture also increases the risks that bacteria will evolve to resist these drugs. Already, drug-resistant bacteria kill 700,000 people a year, yet 73 percent of the antibiotics used worldwide are used on animals. Despite these and many other consequences, both meat consumption and meat production are on the rise. Meat consumption has more than doubled in 20 years, and is expected to rise another 13 percent by 2028. Meat production has also been trending upwards. In the 1970s, it stood at one third of current levels, though it declined slightly in 2019 because of an outbreak of African swine fever. The increase in production has been enabled by many of the things that make that production so problematic: more and more animals are kept in feedlots instead of pastures. This requires their feed to be grown somewhere else, gobbling up more land. Further, such crowding is only possible with antibiotics to prevent infections from spreading in close quarters. With all of this evidence, the report argued that reducing meat consumption in industrial countries is a case of ""listening to the science,"" something world governments have yet to do seriously with regards to this issue. ""We are talking not about a lack of information, and politicians not acting because they don't know,"" the atlas' chief executive editor and head of the International Agricultural Policy Division at Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Dr. Christine Chemnitz said at the launch. ""We are talking about a lack of political will to steer or transition the agricultural sector into a climate-friendly and biodiversity-friendly direction."" A Meat Atlas 2021 graphic summarizes meat's impact on the world. Bartz / Stockmar / CC BY 4.0 Race to the Bottom One clear indication we are headed in the wrong direction, Chemnitz noted, is the sheer numbers of animals slaughtered: 75 billion a year as of 2019. But this death translates directly into profits for the largest meat and dairy companies, Shefali Sharma, one of the report authors and director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) European office, said at the launch. Sharma explained that the top companies are so powerful that they can set the prices they pay to producers at below the cost of production, and governments will either directly or indirectly subsidize the difference. This creates a ""race to the bottom of cheap prices, more animals, more production, more profits,"" she said. However, there is a way up and out. Sharma recommended a three-prong strategy of: Redirecting resources away from industrial agriculture and towards more regenerative approaches. Regulating companies and holding them responsible for the emissions generated by their supply chains. Regenerating by shifting to agroecology. Agroecology means growing food in ways that respects natural limits while incorporating local and traditional knowledge, Stanka Becheva, a report contributor and Food and Agriculture Campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, explained during the launch. ""It's really the only transformative framework which will help move the industrial... farming sector away from the concentration and the devastating impacts it has,"" she said. She also called for a ban on factory farming; turning to more diversified mixed plant and animal farming solutions; ensuring fair prices for small-scale, sustainable farmers; and changing diets to emphasize fresh, local, plant-based food. A Strong Statement One hopeful indicator cited by the report is the shifting attitudes of young people. The atlas highlighted a representative survey conducted by the University of Göttingen in Germany of young adults between 15 and 29 years old. It found that nearly 13 percent of them were either vegan or vegetarian, more than double the percentage of the overall German population. A further approximately 25 percent considered themselves flexitarians and only ate meat every so often. But what was especially striking to Chemnitz was the motivation behind these decisions. ""One thing young people made really clear is that they see their reduced meat consumption as a political statement,"" she said. Their decision was not based on taste or health, but opposition to how the current meat industry operates. The survey found that 75 percent of the vegan and nearly 50 percent of the vegetarian respondents saw themselves as part of the climate movement. Moreover, young people were in favor of government policies directed at creating a more sustainable food system. More than 70 percent of them thought the German government should encourage people to eat a climate-friendly diet and make sure food is produced in an environmentally friendly way. ""This is a strong statement,"" Chemnitz said, ""and it's a strong call for our government to get active."""

Brexit-related trade barriers have resulted in firms in Europe’s largest economy looking for business elsewhere, with German imports sinking nearly 11 per cent year-on-year to 16.1 billion euros ($19.0 billion). While German goods exports to Britain rose 2.6 per cent to 32.1 billion euros, that could not prevent a decline in bilateral trade, by 2.3 per cent to 48.2 billion euros – pushing Britain down to 11th spot from ninth, and from fifth before it voted to leave the EU in 2016. Michael Schmidt, president of the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said an increasing amount of small and medium-sized companies are ceasing to trade (in Britain) because of Brexit-related hurdles. In both May and June, bilateral goods trade between Germany and the UK remained below end-2019 levels – in contrast with every other major German trade partner. “Many small companies simply can’t afford the extra burden of keeping up to date and complying with all the kicked-in customs rules such as health certificates for cheese and other fresh products,” Schmidt said. But the new trade realities had harmed British companies even more than German ones, which were more used to dealing with different customs regimes around the world as many had been exporting to various non-European countries for decades. “In Britain, the picture is different,” Schmidt said, adding that many small firms there had exported mainly to the EU so had to start from scratch when confronted with new customs controls. “For many small British firms, Brexit meant losing access to their most important export market… It’s like shooting yourself in the foot. And this explains why German imports from Britain are in free-fall now.” Related: UK records another 191 Covid deaths as infections surge"

Ardern and the director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield were giving their daily Covid-19 press conference, when a reporter asked them whether an allegation involving a patient and visitor who had “sexual relations” at Auckland hospital was considered a “high-risk activity, in the current climate”. As the question was asked, Ardern’s face rapidly shifted through expressions, from disturbed, to exasperated, to bemused. Dr Bloomfield responded to the question first with a smile: “I think it is a high-risk activity, potentially, however I don’t know any of the details about that interaction.” Ardern followed up with: “I would say, generally, regardless of the Covid status, that kind of thing shouldn’t generally be part of visiting hours, I would have thought.” PM Jacinda Ardern says sexual relations, regardless of Covid status, shouldn’t “generally be part of [hospital] visiting hours.” Ashley Bloomfield: “It’s a high risk activity, potentially.” pic.twitter.com/VeRVXg7QjU — Aaron Dahmen (@dahmenaaron) September 9, 2021 The allegation comes as the Auckland district health board faced criticism for allowing hundreds of visitors to see patients a day, despite a strict city-wide lockdown in place to help stamp out an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant. The daily Covid-19 updates have provided New Zealand with news of case numbers, vaccines and more, but has also proved fertile ground for the occasional gaffe. The Covid-19 minister, Chris Hipkins, made headlines last month, after he encouraged the public to socially distance when they “spread their legs”."

While other countries have said they will eventually vaccinate children, Cuba is believed to be the first to give Covid-19 vaccines to toddlers. In September, it declared that its homegrown vaccines were safe to give to young children. Throughout the pandemic, most in-person classes have been suspended on the island. Instead of going to school, children watch educational programming on television for hours each day. Home internet remains a rarity in the communist-run nation. Cuba has largely focused on developing its own vaccines, rather than depend on other countries for the medications. Local scientists say the Cuban-made vaccines are safe and effective, but so far have provided little data to outside observers. The government has said it will seek WHO approval for its vaccines. To date, according to the Cuban Health Ministry, over four million people have been fully vaccinated. The government has not said how many children have been vaccinated but said a pediatric vaccination campaign began this week in the province of Cienfuegos, where the healthcare system has faced dire shortages with a steep increase in new cases and deaths. The Cuban government also said it hoped to vaccinate over 90 percent of the population of 11.2 million people before reopening international borders in mid-November. Initially the government said it would focus on vaccinating health care workers, the elderly and the hardest hit areas. But following a spike in infections of children believed to be caused by the Delta variant, the government announced it would also prioritize vaccinating young children. ""With the rise in positive cases of Covid-19 in children, its necessary that the family protects itself more and so we are protecting our children and adolescents,"" said the island's chief epidemiologist Dr. Francisco Duran Garcia. To date, Cuba has recorded 6,056 deaths to the coronavirus but officials recently admitted the toll could be far higher."

The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age can reveal Australia and France have begun negotiations to significantly upgrade military co-operation, which would boost inter-operability between their forces. France is already active in the region, with Australian and French troops last month conducting joint exercises in Queensland. Credit:ADF Australia and France currently have a Status of Forces Agreement – which sets out how the forces of each country should operate together – but are exploring options to provide greater access to each other’s militaries. The talks could eventually pave the way for French naval ships to have a permanent presence at Australian naval bases or for troops to rotate through Australian training bases. While France has been active in the region for decades with a focus on its island territories such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia, the country has been looking to ramp up its diplomatic and military presence in the Indo-Pacific amid increased Chinese assertiveness."

Speaking late on Thursday, Putin said the two leaders had agreed to coordinate the countries’ macroeconomic policies, institute common tax and customs measures, and harmonise other financial controls as part of a 28-point roadmap that is expected to increase Russia’s influence over its neighbour. The countries will move to integrate their energy markets while maintaining steeply discounted supplies of natural gas to Belarus, and Russia will provide a further $630m in loans to the cash-strapped Belarusian government, Putin said. The texts of the agreements were not made available and the leaders did not sign any documents publicly. While the two sides announced new economic agreements, they stopped short of introducing a common currency or going into detail on any defence or political agreements, signalling a limit to the extent of the negotiations. Lukashenko, who has been sanctioned by the west for a brutal crackdown on the country’s opposition, has been seen as resisting pressure from Moscow to concede control over government policy in exchange for Russian support. “First the economic foundation must be laid before moving further on the political track,” Putin said after the talks, noting that the two sides had not discussed possible political integration. While the two sides did not openly discuss arms sales or new Russian bases in Belarus, there were signs of growing military cooperation between the countries. Ahead of his sixth meeting with Putin this year, Lukashenko said he hoped to buy a large shipment of weapons, including combat jets and helicopters, as well as the advanced S-400 air defence weapons. Belarus also claimed that Moscow had moved Su-30 fighters to Belarus in order to patrol the country’s borders with Europe. The Kremlin was thought to be leveraging that isolation to pressure Lukashenko into finalising a number of integration projects that would draw Belarus far closer to Russia politically, militarily and economically, even binding the countries with a shared currency. Yet Lukashenko had stalled on implementing the agreements, which were drawn up as part of a 1999 Union State treaty, recognising that they would undermine his position and hand Belarusian sovereignty over to Moscow. A Belarusian ambassador had said that the two sides may sign the agreements on Thursday evening, state media reported. But similar predictions have fallen flat before. The meeting comes just days before the start of the Zapad-2021 military exercises, in which an estimated tens of thousands of Belarusian and Russian troops will participate in planned manoeuvres on Europe’s borders. Moscow has claimed that as many as 200,000 troops were taking part in the training, but that number was believed to be inflated. The exercises, which are held every four years, usually simulate a conflict between Nato and a Russian-led alliance. The 2017 drills were met with considerable alarm in the west, where there were concerns that the exercises could serve to justify a military buildup on Nato’s borders. The response to the 2021 drills, which were set to be held from 10-16 September, has been more muted, although European countries along the Belarusian border have heightened security precautions, in part due to a migrant crisis fomented by the Belarusian leader. “I asked you to come to summarise the results of what’s been done recently in creating the programme of the Union State,” Putin said as the talks opened on Thursday, referring to a decision to further integrate the countries that had stalled since it was first agreed in principle in 1999. “We are moving forward like civilised countries, only together, only as a union … nearly a single people,” said Lukashenko in a rhetorical flourish."
